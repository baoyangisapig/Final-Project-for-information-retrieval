comment: Make no mistake: Poltergeist is a Spielberg film, no matter what the credits say. His stylistic fingerprints are all over the movie, never more so than in the opening third, which turns a suburban haunting into an occasion for Spielbergian movie magic before the ghosts get down to business. Read full review&&At first and final glance, Poltergeist is simply a riveting demonstration of the movies' power to scare the sophistication out of any viewer. It creates honest thrills within the confines of a P.G. rating and reaches for standard shock effects and the forced suspension of disbelief only at the climax, when we realize that the characters are behaving with such obtuseness precisely because they are trapped inside a horror movie. Read full review&&Poltergiest is no nonstop scream express; at times it pulls its punches (Spielberg wants that PG rating), and at times its effects are bigger than life and less than terrifying.

comment: Suspiria truly is one of the absolute classics of the horror genre and anyone who considers themselves to be true students of the cinema owe it to themselves to experience it for themselves, especially if they get a chance to see it on the big screen where it belong. Read full review&&Argento’s deliriously artificial horror film owes as much to Georges Méliès and German Expressionism (specifically The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari) as it does to Jean Cocteau and Grimm fairy tales. = Read full review&&Suspiria is the perfect antipasto. Read full review&&A veteran of Richard Foreman’s Ontological-Hysteric Theater, the deadpan Harper puts her training to good use, gracefully eluding the attacking furniture and skillfully dodging the imploding set, as she flees—arms protectively crossed before her face—out into the night. Read full review&&The original ad campaign boasted that the only thing more terrifying than the last five minutes of SUSPIRIA were the first 90. Actually, it's the first 15 minutes that contain some of the most frightening footage ever committed to celluloid, but why quibble. Read full review&&The movie is a collection of ghoulish creative impulses (some of them gorily sadistic, as when a character is trapped in a room of barbed wire) rather than a coherent story. Read full review&&A ridiculously self-indulgent spree of satanic bogeymannerisms entitled Suspiria, virtually self-destructs in the opening sequence. Eager to menace the audience from every sensory direction, Argento doesn't so much create and sustain an illusion of terror as invite you to marvel at his garish ingenuity, at the spectacle of a filmmaker who can't resist overstylizing and upstaging his material. Read full review&&Right from the get-go the music sets the tone and prepares you for something sinister. It makes for one memorable opening credits sequence. When the movie actually starts however, the same track is still loudly thrumming in your ears despite the protagonist doing nothing more than arriving&&Suspiria is an amazing arthouse film by Dario Argento that though is cheesy at times works because of its bold colour scheme, fantastic punk soundtrack and beautiful filmmaking.&&Decidi assistir principalmente por causa do remake desse ano. Um filme visualmente maravilhoso, com aquele vermelho claustrofóbico e muita violência. O roteiro deixa a desejar nos últimos 20 minutos. Com certeza assistiria novamente.&&Over the years and now with this new revision to Argento's classic, I must say that we have idealized this film too much. I still think it's a great horror film, especially because all the style and tonalities that Argento printed on it are more than enough to talk for hours, but the&&the stakes of ruggedness..Suspiria Suspiria is a character driven horror about a girl who joins a ballet academy and finds out the hard way that there actually might something else be going on behind the show business. The art designing and visual effects is the weakest link, why it fails&&Really cool visuals and music, but not much beyond that. Story was cheesy and the scares don't hold up at all nowadays.
Still, the aesthetic and soundtrack kinda make it worth a watch.&&While the film is well directed, I was not a fan of the story at all. I thought that it was too fast-paced and we didn't really get a chance to explore anything. It let me very unsatisfied in that regards.&&

comment: All music docs are not created equal. Yes, some are formulaic. But some are beautiful, some are singular, some are marvels of storytelling. And some, like Searching for Sugar Man, are all three. Read full review&&A musical detective story, this enthralling documentary focuses on a little-known American musician whose haunting voice and poetic lyrics were essentially unknown in his own country, but had a massive impact across the globe. Read full review&&Rodriguez' inner peace wins us over. He seems to have enjoyed recording music, fathering kids, cleaning houses, playing sold-out gigs and simply strumming a guitar in his kitchen. Searching for Sugar Man reminds us that a wise man knows lasting riches are never the result of record sales. Read full review&&The tale is better than the telling – and the soundtrack's better still – but music this monumental demands its moment. Now go and buy the album. Read full review&&Sugar Man is most interesting when it touches on the conditions that combined to draw a cult hero out of some decent music and a generously enabled, imagination-firing mystique.

Since a review needs to be a ridiculous 150 characters long, here's the rest.....best documentary I have ever seen, best documentary I have ever seen, best documentary I have ever seen, best documentary I have ever seen, best&&This is a terrific documentary about a remarkably talented man and the vagaries of the music business. Indeed, the vagaries of life. See it.

Slow to start but beautiful story and thrilling ending.

Rodriguez's message is so heartfelt and his voice so haunting I would say it's sort of a blend of Dylan and James Taylor that you can't believe you never heard of him before this movie came out.

comment: In every sense, I Am Love is a stunning achievement. Read full review&&Often soaringly beautiful melodrama. Read full review&&I Am Love is a bold and thrilling masterpiece -- the introduction of a major talent to the world's stage. Read full review&&This intense and almost operatic Italian family melodrama recalls the best of Douglas Sirk. Read full review&&Director Luca Guadagnino is having so much fun setting up the Kubrickian chill (even Barry Lyndon's Marisa Berenson is on hand) that when Emma and the much younger Antonio finally come together in warming Sanremo, their tryst almost sneaks up on you. Read full review&&As a full-on celebration of beauty in all its forms, this gem of a contemporary melodrama invites viewers to plunge into a world of unerring taste and luxury, where even tragedy comes softly when it inevitably arrives. Read full review&&Here the homages/critiques of old craft and form are often laughably mangled, and nothing sexy, profound or illuminating results. For all its prettiness, it's the sort of picture that gives the arthouse a bad name. Read full review&&This is a movie for adults who are a little bit more curious and wiser than most in the movie-going audience. That's too bad, really, because Tilda Swinton between this movie and "Julia" has given us two of her very best performances. If she isn't nominated for Best Actress in this role,&&A magnificent film. The story, performances, and score are often sumptuous and grandiose. And with good reason: the intent is lush and emotionally absorbing storytelling. It completely worked for me.

It did seem clear that style was placed above substance though.&&I would give this film a 10 for beauty: fashion, food, art, architecture, and filming style. Some of the acting is also a 10 (Emma, Ida, the mother in law). The film falls short though in telling a compelling story and many of the characters are completely flat.&&Watching "I am Love" feels like flipping through magazines; a splash of 80s "Architectural Digest", forever missed "Gourmet" and as many italian fashion magazines as you can think of. Within all its glam and glum there is a plausible story line, one that feels real and moving if Tilda&&Absolutely terrible! Sweepingly pretentious; clumsy; a preposterous story with wooden, utterly unlikeable characters; coupled with Tilda Swinton's cold, unblinkingly alienesque face made this literally the worst film I have ever seen.
