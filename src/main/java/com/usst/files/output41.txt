comment: Effervescent, unflappable, supremely pleased with herself, Cher (delightfully played by the much-publicized Alicia Silverstone) is the comic centerpiece of Clueless, a wickedly funny teen-age farce from writer-director Amy Heckerling that, like its heroine, turns out to have more to it than anyone could anticipate.

If you thought the similarity between, say, “Coco” and “The Book of Life” was a case of animators not looking resourcefully enough for inspiration, how about the trifecta of “Smallfoot,” “Missing Link,” and DreamWorks’s upcoming “Abominable”? Read full review&&As in Laika’s other efforts, the humor in the film is more wry than gut-busting, but Chris Butler has developed some truly inventive comic characters. Read full review&&One wishes the script might have shared the degree of precision that has obviously been applied to the technical side of the production, which is resplendent in visual dazzle from the smallest beads of sweat on a character’s forehead to the vintage knit fabrics to those sprawling exotic vistas. Read full review&&Fantastic, funny, giant adventure movie with a trip around the world. I would recommend it to any family looking for some quality fun at the theatre.&&A meet and greet with one of the most fantastic legendary beings of the world, and the stop-motion genre. One of the plot's strengths are the characters with own soul and charming, and the fresh, natural humor. Just stay in your seat for enjoy and watch the surprises that come with the exit credits.&&All Laika films are a pleasant reminder of the value and beauty of hand-made art. Stop motion is an endangered kind of animation, and the fact that there is a studio that continues to work in this style and devotes so much attention to every detail in the frame is stunning. The visual&&So, I’m a pretty big fan of the animation studio Laika. They have crafted some of the most beautifully animated stop-motion films of all time and I really admire them. They are one of the few studios in Hollywood that only makes films for the art, not the money (as the box office clearly&&The guys at Laika have pretty much perfected stop motion so much that it basically looks like stylized CGI. Missing Link is gorgeous in the visual aspect. The CGI is so smooth and the visual effects so breathtaking that, like I said, it seriously looks like regular CGI, even though it's stop&&The animation style of Missing Link is beautiful. Some of the wider shots are truly worthy of being hung up on a wall, and I could watch a large number of films that have a similar style to this. The story, however, lacks depth. It goes from point, to point, to point without the main&&From 1900 to the first photographed black hole, from White men ruling the nation to women finally being allowed to serve as police officers, political correctness seems to get the better of our crazy nature, to the extent where a perfectly healthy desire to achieve equal rights becomes our&&

comment: If there’s anything that Active Measures does most effectively, it’s to demonstrate the depths and the breadth of the corruption, the criminality, the immorality operating in contemporary politics. Read full review&&Active Measures delivers a well-researched and smartly laid-out cinematic thesis that connects the myriad dots in skillful fashion. Read full review&&There’s a priceless scene in Jack Bryan’s new documentary, Active Measures, where McCain is seen smirking through a speech delivered by the Russian president, as he sneers with theatrical menace in the senator’s direction. Read full review&&While it’s not as if the film comes up with some smoking gun that Robert Mueller hasn’t yet, it fills in the Trump-Russia connection in a dogged, rigorously reported, eyebrow-raising way. Read full review&&This formidable film is sometimes zealous to a fault: The credits cite more than 200 sources of archival material, from The Washington Post to YouTube channels. It’s a lot to take in, as names and numbers zip by, yet missing some of its points may be healthy. To explore every moment is to risk overdosing on outrage. Read full review&&Bryan’s done his homework, mapping out an elaborate network of past wrongdoings with news clippings and TV footage. If the just deserts that this film demands ever come to pass, it will almost certainly be the most copiously photographed treason in a long and illustrious American tradition. Read full review&&Active Measures is an assault on the eyes, the ears, the mind. By coming on so strong, so fevered, Bryan achieves the dubious feat of making his host of documented facts, reasonable inferences, and alarming subjects for further research all seem seem less persuasive than if they had been presented more soberly. Read full review&&Essential. A documentary on the current pivot of democracy! This is a weapon against Hitler were he Putin...&&I loved the way this documentary put it all together in one package for me although the delivery was dizzying and sometimes hard to follow. It gives a strong argument for Russian collusion that is unabashedly(and succeeding)dividing the American people. This is the cancer that must be cut out.&&"Active Measures" is an incredible documentary that every American and people across the world need to see. Truly mind-blowing and required viewing.&&Well researched and presented. If you are incapable of understanding the mechanics and outcomes of russians' methods (to disrupt, dismantle and destroy democratic societies) even after ingesting this documentary, you are indeed deplorable :).&&Very good documentary. Keeps you interested until the end. It expose the real problem of propaganda via social media and the internet. How hill prepare the western world is against it. The reliance on underlines written press titles is maybe the part that gets annoying. I did love all the&&I wouldn't say it falls flat. The content is good, the message is important, though it does seem to be preaching to the choir. Stylistically, just a mess, in my opinion. A lot of talking heads with no time to breathe. Mediocre quality of many clips. Not sure who thought dance music would add&&F*** your "experts".. why should I believe them? because they have been indoctrinated and given a special PHD or Masters degree paper telling them they can form so called facts? I think for myself through my own research. Don't need your garbage anti-Russian views. Last I checked Russia is a&&
