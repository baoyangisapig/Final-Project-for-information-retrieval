[03 Dec 1984, p.78]&&At the very least, a warmly old-fashioned soap opera with several significant new twists. And for all its flaws, Falling in Love is one of those ordinary-seeming modern films that present unremarkable characters in the throes of all-too-familiar contemporary crises. When films in this genre succeed fully and realistically in mirroring the audience's concerns, they aren't ordinary at all.

Read full review&&As a phenomenon, the hip-hop, breakdancing, sidewalk graffiti and rap music culture lends itself well to a comic book approach and to his credit director Sam Firstenberg doesn’t try to interject too much reality into the picture. Read full review&&Breakin' 2 slights dramatic matters to concentrate exclusively on dancing. The movie contains so much of it that it's exhausting even to watch, but at least the choreography isn't being executed by John Travolta. Read full review&&It turns out to be under-powered and low-wattage. Breakin' 2's plot could use about six months on the Nautilus equipment to tone it up. [19 Dec 1984, p.C5]&&Breakin' 2 turned out to be pure, laugh-a-minute cheeseball entertainment. Granted, it's utterly terrible, with stiff, amateurish acting, enough vivid Day-Glo to blind an army of sunglasses-wearing Corey Harts, and the thinnest and hoariest of thin, hoary old plots. But the camp value is through the roof. Read full review&&Fast-paced, fully aware of its own foolishness, and with lively dance sequences, BREAKIN' 2 is an enjoyable diversion for those who like breakdancing. Read full review&&And all this twaddle about how people are more important than dollars, in a sequel that was rushed out by producers Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus to capitalize on the summertime windfall of "Breakin' " is almost hilarious. Read full review&&I love memes and all, but I don't think that this deserves anything higher than 5/10.

BTW I hope you enjoy Super Mario Galaxy 2: Electric Boogaloo.&&

comment: A thoroughly entertaining comedy delight about young marriage. Read full review&&Redford and the Oscar-nominated Natwick, fresh from their Broadway triumph in the play, perform with the ease familiarity brings, and Fonda and Boyer also display the appropriate lightness of touch. Read full review&&Barefoot in the Park is one of the few plays to be reincarnated on-screen while playing on the Broadway stage. Happily, it loses little in transition.

Read full review&&Gene Saks directs his first film so clumsily that he even muffs Mike Nichol’s exploitation of the climbing the stairs gag that kept Neil Simon’s feeble farce running for 79 years on Broadway. Read full review&&Gene Saks, directing his first movie, has paced it so unevenly and allowed such glaring mismatches of scenic backgrounds and even of gag sequences that it looks as though his costly picture was made by people who didn't know their way around.

comment: While The LEGO Ninjago Movie does venture into overly cliched and cheesy territory at times, the performances of its actors and excited attitude of the material keep it from ever going stale. Read full review&&Lego Ninjago sparkles with humor and kung fu style, yet it’s a few pieces short of greatness. Read full review&&A perfectly adequate family film for kids who love watching things they've seen many times before (which is to say, most kids), it offers plenty of chuckles for their parents but nothing approaching the glee of that first Lego Movie. Read full review&&The Lego Ninjago Movie does fit into the decidedly silly, self-aware sphere of the Lego movie franchise. Comparisons won’t help it any, though: unlike the two previous entries, this one feels a little worn around the edges. Read full review&&Credit is due to Jackie Chan, who gives his all to make Ninjago work. Read full review&&The action and jokes pile up with exhausting repetitiveness. But Theroux and Franco make a truly hilarious team. Read full review&&Ninjago’s sprawling team of screenwriters – nine credits in all – throw every joke they can at the screen, but few of them stick in your memory for longer than a moment.

When the LEGO movie hit the 2014 goal, and the LEGO Batman movie hit the 2017 goal, hopefully the LEGO Ninjago movie can hit the goal,funny and entertaining.&&The LEGO series strikes again. Ninjago is a (perhaps un)surprisingly poignant family tale with ninjas, robots and Jackie Chan. It shares its same striking stop-motion style with the other films but is somewhat narrower in scope, being a character-examining drama like LEGO Batman but lacking&&Forget the ninjas, the robots, and the giant cat; THE LEGO NINJAGO MOVIE is about a son willing to sacrifice himself to salvage his evil dad. Evil cannot be stopped, it always finds a way to return - but it can be changed, transformed into an agent of good, and thus is evil conquered.&&How soon can you say that you will bore your audience with your own franchise? I think Lego can answer that with its new movie; The Lego Ninjago Movie and don't misunderstand me, this movie is not a failure in every sense of the word or a disappointment, it is simply that what worked so well&&A mediocre film that is ok; this was a somewhat disappointing experience. There are a few solid laughs. but the storyline drags, has clunky moral messaging, and the script lacks the subtle flair of other Lego offerings.
