comment: A comedy of discomfort -- and one of their (Coen brothers) best, most insightful and most provocative films. Read full review&&Have I mentioned A Serious Man is so rich and funny? This isn't a laugh-laugh movie, but a wince-wince movie. Those can be funny too.

Read full review&&A Serious Man is not only hauntingly original, it’s the final piece of the puzzle that is the Coens. Combine suburban alienation, philosophical inquiry, moral seriousness, a mixture of respect for and utter indifference to Torah, and, finally, a ton of dope, and you get one of the most remarkable oeuvres in modern film.

comment: The result is provocative, even startling, and more edifying than you might expect.
