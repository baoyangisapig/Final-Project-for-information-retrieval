comment: Memoirs of an Invisible Man is one of Chevy Chase's best movies. Though more or less a comedy, the picture gives Chase a chance to do much more than smirk and be a wise guy, while providing a good showcase for his dry style of humor. [28 Feb 1992, p.D1]&&Memoirs of an Invisible Man' is a generally entertaining bit of nonsense, a slick blend of suspense, comedy and special effects. [28 Feb 1992, p.3F]&&The special effects used to illustrate these drawbacks are remarkable, but the movie around them isn't. There's precious little chemistry between Chase and Hannah, there's not much real menace in the over-the-top performance by Sam Neill as a CIA assassin, and there's nothing but a skin-deep gloss to Carpenter's direction. [03 March 1992, p.E4]&&While Memoirs of an Invisible Man has its moments - like so many Chevy Chase movies - you spend an awful lot of time waiting between laughs. [28 Feb 1992, p.28]&&When played for laughs, this works well, while the action scenes generate an atmosphere of paranoia and menace; but failing to explore the pathos of Nick's predicament, the film becomes an inflated lightweight comedy whose shortcomings are all too visible.

The film has no rhythm, it's stagy and inauthentic-looking, and the patchwork script has that tinny ring that so often infects movies about real people. [06 Dec 1982, p.152]&&Jessica Lange brings so much energy and personal involvement to her portrayal of Frances Farmer that you can't help but feel sorry for her; nothing else in the film remotely matches her talent and dedication, and she seems alone—and even slightly absurd—in her feverish creativity. Read full review&&Biographical stinker that insists on remaining unreasonably disjointed for 2 1/2 hours. [28 Jan 1983, p.D1]&&

comment: The film is never less than engaging, and it’s just about always clever. Read full review&&This is an appealingly polished thriller, with something modest but profound to say about how selfish choices can ripple across decades. Read full review&&The action is thrilling and the science fiction stuff compelling, but there are several occasions where it feels like the screenplay is talking down to its audience, most notably during its heavy-handed climax. Read full review&&An odd film like this needs a charismatic anchor in its lead role to keep it from losing its human connection and Boyd Holbrook just can’t muster the energy to do that. It’s a strangely flat, unengaging performance that doesn't match the ambition of the overall piece. Read full review&&A watchable failure, at best. Read full review&&In The Shadow Of The Moon is a disappointing misfire all around, but no matter—like so many other Netflix original films, it’ll be reabsorbed into the streaming void soon enough. Read full review&&The dedicated entertainment junkie now has more options than ever before. So if you’re wondering which logy, derivative, visually pedestrian piece of made-for-Netflix pulp you should avoid at all costs this week, it would be hard to top In the Shadow of the Moon. Read full review&&In the shadow of the moon is a very interesting movie about a police officer encountering strange repeated events that he can not explain. And I wish I could say more without spoiling. It's a science fiction detective film, which blows the viewer away. Unfortunately one of the major plot&&Pretty good movie.

'The only way to solve the problems we are currently facing ist to travel to the past and make some changes'? Is this the main take-away?

So where is the point?&&This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.&&Another, terrible, politically driven product... It clearly shows up how a strong black woman stops angry republicans - because you know, they like guns and militia stuff, and just like any SJW driven movie it gives a clear message... we will not stop, we will even kill innocents to get what&&I thought this is the documentary about exploration of the moon. Noticed the mistake fast, but kept watching as I thought it may be some interesting thriller. Acting is horrible. Every actor in the movie is bad. Action scenes are boring.

summary: Buffy is so popular. She rules her high school as head cheerleader. But it's not all fun and games.

comment: Buffy The Vampire Slayer should be a mess, but it's not. It's a mini-comic triumph, and although it's technically a teen movie, it's in the tiny genre of sophisticated, darkly funny teen films such as Heathers and Pump Up the Volume. [4 Aug 1992, p.C1]&&The movie is a mess from start to finish. But then again, this jerky, haphazard approach is part of the movie's goofy charm. Read full review&&Buffy the Vampire Slayer, a slight, good-humored film that's a lot more painless than might have been expected. Ms. Swanson's funny, deadpan delivery holds the story together reasonably well, as does the state-of-the-art Val-speak that constitutes most of Buffy's dialogue. Read full review&&If you've seen Buffy the Vampire Slayer's poster, you've seen the movie. Otherwise, this pallid crossbreeding of vampire horror with Valley Girl vamping has no surprises. Read full review&&In short, when Buffy starts getting fangy, it stops being tangy. It gets all serious and earnest and flops as a teen-age love story and as a vampire thriller and even as a parody. It's not even a "Fright Night," much less a "Near Dark," and only hints at a "Lost Boys" ambience. [31 Jul 1992, p.38]&&Buffy, the Vampire Slayer is lightweight and fun -- not great fun, but it has its moments. The high school satire angle is both authentic and good-natured. [31 Jul 1992, p.D1]&&Director Fran Rubel Kuzui's frenzied mistrust of her material is almost total. Somebody should have given her a garlic necklace -- or a Miltown -- and told her to chill out. Read full review&&This movie isn't a classic but the action is cool, the jokes are funny and the cast is great. The movie is
a decent movie and it's what you expect, no more no less. Give the movie a shot and you'll enjoy it, I've
seen way worse movies than this, B+.&&A favorite of mine growing up. Fun time where you don't have to think too much.&&This is a complicated rating. Yes this is written by Joss Whedon and the name Buffy is no coincidence. He sold the idea / script to the production company and later left the project because he got dissatisfied with the changes they made (Some will say they butchered his script / ideas). He&&It's early 90's cheese at it's best. It was safe, predictable, had decent, but over the top acting, had unnecessary and unbelievable action scenes and it even had the "Let's prepare ourselves" montage with a cheesy song. Buffy the Vampire Slayer is not a good movie, but it's very&&Buffy the Vampire Slayer is simply awful. Even the writer Joss Whedon has made it clear that this is not what he had envisioned. Bad acting, bad lines after bad lines. Why would Donald Sutherland waste his time with something like this?&&So I was a huge fan of the TV show which was awesome and has basically nothing in common with the original movie, except having a teenage girl named Buffy whose destiny is to slay vampires as a Vampire Slayer. This movie was so boring, I literally, fell asleep 15 minutes into it. I woke up&&

comment: The chemical energy between Bullock and Reynolds is fresh and irresistible. Read full review&&Hilarious fun. Read full review&&It's as predictable and comforting as a Happy Meal, but it must be said that The Proposal manages to elicit some genuinely amusing moments. Read full review&&The premise of The Proposal is one big cliche. Read full review&&It's the material that stinks, failing to give even an old pro like White more than a couple of modest laughs.

Every scene was a gem that made me laugh.&&This movie was surprisingly funny and well done. Especially after reading the reviews I felt I was taking a chance. But as usual the reviews are misleading. Based on the positive reviews, we went to see "Hangover", which was very disappointing. "The Proposal" gets metsa reviews from the&&WHAT I LIKED: It's rare for this type of film to have a genuinely fresh tone and plot, but 'The Proposal' surely does. It's a gripping tale that leans towards some desperately funny comedy between it's 2 main characters who are well devised and acted excellentlyWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: Strip it&&The Proposal is predictable, you know what will happen. Despite this, there is some funny moments and a great cast. There is great charisma between Reynolds and Bullock.&&This film was...hmmmm... Interesting, I did not see much purpose so it hasn't groen on me as a good film, but I can say that it could have been worse!&&No chemistry whatsoever in this terribly painful film. One of the worst movies I have ever endured. The cliche's are pounded out and exploited and the writing is awful.&&
