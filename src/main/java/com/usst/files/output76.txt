director: Charlie Paul

summary: Made over the course of fifteen years, For No Good Reason explores the connection between art and life through the eyes of Ralph Steadman, the last of the original Gonzo visionaries. Insightful, humorous, and visually stunning, this is a study in honesty, friendship, and the ambition that drives an artist.

The odd camera angles presage the evil that will infect the happy home and put us on an eye-level with the boys whose spats gradually disappear as the two come to rely on each other. [26 Oct 1984, p.21]&&It is to the credit of Mr. Apted, and to a cast including some very believable young actors, that Firstborn moves swiftly and smoothly enough to dispel much nitpicking about plot points, at least for a time. Read full review&&Despite its weaknesses, Firstborn is a movie that deals sensitively with the emotional trials of single-parent families. And it is one of the few that treats adolescents with respect. This film is a must-see for parents and teen-agers and could provoke a long, long talk. [26 Oct 1984, p.C1]&&The first half of Firstborn is a first-rate domestic melodrama, faultlessly acted by all concerned, though you may wonder if the interactions would not have been a bit more compelling had the invading force been a bit less obviously, obnoxiously evil. The second half goes over the edge into a Hollywood hell. [26 Oct 1984]&&This flawed but interesting Freudian melodrama spends about 70 minutes making points and the last 30 minutes losing them.
