comment: Not to be hyperbolic, but Richard Linklater's first big-budget movie may be the Jules and Jim of bank-robber movies, thanks to its astonishing handling of period detail and its gentleness of spirit, both buoyed by a gliding lightness of touch. Read full review&&A fast-paced, entertaining motion picture that replaces gritty tension with a lightly-dramatic character interaction that occasionally borders on straight comedy. Read full review&&If Mr. Linklater is not entirely at ease with action sequences (or with the obligatory having-fun montage once the brothers become successful), he still makes this (after ''Before Sunrise'' and ''Suburbia'') another admirable directorial stretch. Read full review&&Director Richard Linklater ("Dazed and Confused") should have taken a cue from the music -- the film needs a lot more snap. Read full review&&The film chronicles their criminal career in a low-key, meandering way; we're hanging out with them more than we're being told a story. Read full review&&In his true-life film about four brothers who robbed banks out West during the late teens and early '20s, Richard Linklater seems to achieve the impossible: He makes Ethan Hawke bearable. Read full review&&Scored to a disarmingly quaint array of fiddle-and-banjo tunes, The Newton Boys has so little in the way of blood or rancor that before long, you begin to notice that there's no real drama in it, either.

comment: Rocky III looks good -- a lean film with a bit of muscle. Stallone makes it eminently watchable. And that's probably more than we should have expected. [28 May 1982, p.C1]&&It's as much fun as ever, a ground-meat-and-potatoes movie, with guys beating hell out of each other to a disco beat. Stallone pulls no punches; the familiar refrain features the Rocky I score, along with its characters and moral simplicity. Read full review&&As audience movie-making in its purest form, the film is a delight, but it's also so obviously based on Stallone's own personal struggle with success that the mind boggles as to what Rocky can possibly do next. Read full review&&The real question with Rocky III was how Sylvester Stallone could twist the plot to make an interesting difference. He manages. As usual, Stallone the writer-director is less successful in handling all the dramatic interims than staging the battles. Read full review&&Rocky III crawls along without dramatic impetus, failing to convey the big emotions and missing the humor of the first two films. Read full review&&It's not giving away state secrets to report that Rocky finds that success has made him fat and that to triumph again, he has to learn to be ''hungry.'' Rocky's problem is thus not that of America in the 80's but more like America in the affluent 60's and early 70's. Read full review&&Rocky III, unlike its twin predecessors, is a charmlessly manipulative movie. The magic is kaput. [28 May 1982]&&This was great, not as great as one nor two, but great a third one, this is the original Dark Knight Rises, from a fallen hero, to a risen hero.&&Eye Of The Tiger
Rocky III is another entertaining addition to the classic franchise.&&Definitely a step down for the series but still a solid entry. Stallone is good despite the screenplay.&&you thought i was tough..Rocky III There is a sense of wanting more for the character but at this point it seems obvious that they are stretching their way down the road where box office is given more importance than quality of it. Rocky III is flat out predictable and a typical sport&&Rocky was a great film, Rocky II was by miles better than the original.... In 1982 we saw the return of Sylvester Stallone as he returns as Rocky Balboa in "ROCKY III" and this time Mr.T is his opponent to try and defeat. Rocky (Stallone) gets KO'd and destroyed by Clubber Lang (Mr.T) then&&
