comment: Anyone can come up with jokes about incestuous rednecks or pubic hair that "looks like Osama bin Laden's beard," but it takes guts to make a comedy in which the Indian-American hero accuses an African-American TSA agent of racial profiling, all so he won't get caught smuggling weed onto a plane.

The man known for taking things too far also appears to know exactly where to stop. Read full review&&The House With a Clock in Its Walls is easily Eli Roth’s best motion picture, and that’s not an attempt to damn the film with faint praise.

Read full review&&The Last Kiss is more a capable-craftsman film than a work of genuine dramatic insight, but here and there it opens a window onto the terror and wonder of grown-up life, one its characters don't especially want to look through. Read full review&&The fallibility of the romantic ideal -- which is nonetheless indispensable on screen and off -- is something Hollywood has trouble dealing with. "The Break-up," in which Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughan did just what the title promised, would have been a more notable exception if it were anything like a good movie. The Last Kiss, while not quite a good movie either, at least deserves credit for its honesty. Read full review&&Unfortunately, nothing about Tony Goldwyn's vapid, navel-gazing, claustrophobic adaptation of a 2001 Italian film rings remotely true. Read full review&&Wow...whats up with all the mediocre comments? I absolutely loved The Last Kiss. Nothing felt forced, the entire story just kind of rolled without the typical clichés, and predictable scenes. I found myself laughing throughout most of the movie. Even some of the serious moments&&I thought this movie was thoroughly engaging. It definitely surpassed my expectations. The cast was uniformly excellent. Blythe Danner was a standout. I recommend this movie without hesitation.&&Very underrated. This is a sensitive and real movie about commitment as youth moves into adult hood. It has a heart, laughs and you'll identify with the characters. The acting is great all around. Some of the story around the parent's is a little forced but it doesn't get in&&Decent film of the chick-flick variety. A story of infidelity with a new angle.&&No, it's not Garden State. It wasn't directed by Zak Braff, It wasn't written by Zak Braff, it stars Zak Braff and that's it. It is, in fact, a remake of an Italian comedy that was a quick paced ensemble piece that emphasized the comedy about four friends on the brink of&&The smartest film?? voice of our generation??? wait wait this is paul haggis the king of conveniet writing, he ll put in more intersting characters that are not major parts in the movie (izzy, chris) to conveniently make it into a story that we can all see coming(chris running into jenna).&&What pretentious garbage. Sorry, not interested in self-pity, or a pathetic mid-life crisis from someone who's barely 30. "No more surprises"? Poor boy, he wants to shag other women, preferably younger hot looking girls. And his own woman is conveniently an empty husk of a person,&&

comment: From Germany, the deeply disturbing domestic tragedy Three Peaks is another film of understated but driving intensity starring Alexander Fehling, a.k.a. the Paul Newman of German cinema. Read full review&&This is a powerful and beautifully shot film of love and survival. Read full review&&Superbly crafted, utterly gripping. Read full review&&The film ably plumbs the fears of a well-meaning man who tries his best to play by the rules of middle-aged courtship. Read full review&&Three Peaks is not a devastating film like “Force Majeure” — another mountain-set foreign film about the exposure of fissures in a family dynamic — but it is a satisfying one. There’s just enough closure to its inconclusive climax to allow you to relax, even if it doesn’t give you much to terribly ponder during the drive home. Read full review&&This is a demanding and fitfully rewarding film which focuses minutely on the shifting relationships between its three protagonists. Read full review&&If Zabeil didn’t want to deliver a formula picture, he needed to come up with something better than the formula. Read full review&&A German man goes on vacation with his French girlfriend and her son. The relationship between the substitute father and the young boy is sometimes warm, even though the son would rather see his biological parents reconcile. The location in the Italian Dolomites is stunningly picturesque and&&

comment: Among its many notable achievements, Memoir of War is one of the best films I’ve seen about the ways in which grief can pull a person in both directions simultaneously. Whereas the film’s first half plays more like a thriller, the second half proves to be an emotionally wrenching interlude perched on pins and needles. Read full review&&Anchored by a brilliant Mélanie Thierry, whose stone-eyed lead performance is at the center of almost every frame, Finkiel’s film never betrays the distance that Duras inserted between herself and her own experiences, or that she wrote from the perspective of a vessel as much as she did a subject. Read full review&&Every once in a while, the story of an individual slips through the cracks. Memoir of War is one of those stories and, as such, provides an unseen perspective to a plotline that we all know well. Read full review&&Ms. Thierry plays Marguerite with an understatement that can be enigmatic, seductive, or deliberately confounding. The picture as a whole doesn’t do justice to her committed performance. Read full review&&While clearly adoring Duras’s work, Finkiel doesn’t credit the strength it took for her to ruthlessly detail the experience. Read full review&&There are few elements of suspense or intrigue in this drama, as it’s largely an inward journey into Duras’ agonized, shaky state of mind over the unknown whereabouts of her Resistance-member husband, Robert Anselme. Read full review&&Writer/director Emmanuel Finkiel tries very hard to adapt Duras’ modernist storytelling tactics to Memoir of War and, at times, even succeeds in translating the author’s opaque blurring of the objective and the subjective.

comment: Wind sometimes dawdles, but it’s a sports movie with soul. Read full review&&Wind is a vigorous and colorful piece of filmmaking that never quite shakes free of an embarrassingly trite, formulaic screenplay. [11 Sep 1992, p.H]&&The real reason to see this movie, though, is because it makes a big yacht race seem so glorious, such grand adventure. Ballard is a former cinematographer with a knack for visualizing the outdoors. Read full review&&The real disappointment is that director Carroll Ballard delivers such powerful racing scenes and seascapes that you wish he could have done better on dry land. But you can't argue that Ballard doesn't deliver an original, often breathtaking, view of nature. [17 Sep 1992, p.4E]&&Wind is about the huff and puff that's needed to win the America's Cup regatta. It's about tacking faster than your Australian competitors. It's about winning for your country and yourself -- to stirring music. It's also about an hour too long. Read full review&&Wind, an adventure loosely drawn on yachtsman Dennis Conner's run for the America's Cup, won't sail for luff or money. A wonky idea from the weighing of the anchor, it's essentially an attempt to remake Rocky with a spinnaker. Read full review&&Ballard made The Black Stallion and Never Cry Wolf, and he's good with spectacle;: His second-unit crew this time found ways to shoot the controlled violence of big sails in good wind that take the breath away. But the rest of Wind is just out there flapping. What a mess. [14 Sep 1992, p.C5]&&
