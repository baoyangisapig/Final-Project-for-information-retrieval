Hughes seems to have relaxed his usual controlling, compulsively tidy style, taking full advantage of the improvisational talents of his star. Read full review&&Half-way through Uncle Buck, however, the plot abandons reality and is content to settle into the realm of cheap yuks. The film suffers accordingly and becomes so much like the unnatural potato chips and pretzel food snacks that our hero is fond of noshing. Uncle Buck tastes great, yes. But it sure doesn't fill you up. [16 Aug 1989, p.D6]&&Hughes succeeds more than he has any right to in Uncle Buck because he's able to override sitcom cliche with generosity. It's a smart idea to let Candy play feelings instead of just fatness and bluster. For a movie that isn't really that good, Uncle Buck is surprisingly likable. [16 Aug 1989, p.77]&&A John Hughes movie is 15 minutes of material stretched into a 90-minute feature by a rec-room rack from the Karloff estate; the only question is whether the 15 have their comic compensations. Uncle Buck has a few, though they're typically compromised by the cut-and-paste nature of the rest.

It is not screamingly funny, romantically piquant, bitter or even, in most ways, unusual.

comment: A film that takes you by surprise, refusing to relinquish its grim, fascinating hold. Better yet, it has crept up on us without much advance promotional fanfare. The less known about its twists, the better. Read full review&&Patrick McGrath's novel provides a solid and suspenseful story, even if it loses much of its bite in Mackenzie's hands. Read full review&&Asylum is as dark as Dracula's mood on a moonless night, and people suffering from depression should think twice before opening the coffin. This thing would put off Mary Poppins. Read full review&&Alternately tedious, cliched and unintentionally funny. Read full review&&I hope to God that Patrick McGrath's novel Asylum, about a bunch of repressed Brits manipulating the stuffing out of one another in a 1950s psychiatric hospital, is better than the shallowly competent exercise in nastiness that British director David Mackenzie and screenwriter Patrick Marber have made of it. Read full review&&The best you can say of Asylum is that it plays like a topless "Twilight Zone."

comment: If you told me Bird Box was based on a Stephen King story — yep, I could see that. It’s that chilling. That suspenseful. And oh yes, that scary. Read full review&&It's Sandra Bullock and the ensemble that heap some heft into this standard scorched Earth story. Read full review&&Bird Box could easily be reduced to, “It’s A Quiet Place meets Blindness crossed with The Happening!” And that high-concept pitch wouldn’t exactly be wrong. Read full review&&In the end, Bird Box’s most significant shortcoming is that it’s just too inert and unfocused to work as sci-fi horror. Read full review&&It’s entertaining enough to be worth watching for fans of the genre or of Bullock, who turns in a strong performance as a woman who has motherhood thrust onto her in a world loaded with peril. Read full review&&There’s a fundamental problem here, one of conception, not of execution. Read full review&&The effort behind Bird Box was to make something better than a standard horror movie, but the result is dull and half-hearted. It’s not serious enough or important enough to transcend the horror genre, but neither is it visceral enough to hold up as a regulation horror movie. Read full review&&This movie is one of the best I've seen this year. It had a great emotional and keep-you-on-edge plot that kept your interest till the very end. I was disappointed when the movie ended and I wish it came out before "A Quiet Place" so people could stop comparing; I don't think it's anything&&nonstop tension and a new spin on an apocalyptic world. In the review I am going to write I am going to say "If you took The Birds, Dawn of the Dead and The Happening and tossed them into a blender, Birdbox is what you get". Frankly, I was quite impressed with it. I like end of the world&&Bird Box resulta ser interesante y entretenida pese a que el argumento se parece mucho a otras conocidas películas pero esta ok y Sandra Bullock genial como siempre.&&A decent thriller that some people are casting as a horror movie, whilst it contains some horror elements I did not find it all scary and instead found it a more compelling human tale of loss, life and acceptance.&&It's useless to have an interesting plot and to start up your narrative in the most important point when you deal with the rest of the story interspersed with the moments that led you to that exact point, especially to problematically build a very poor climax seasoned with an unsatisfactory&&Very disappointed with this film. It was a cliche apocalyptic psychological thriller that failed to hit the mark. I was cautious going into this with Bullock as the lead, and I was right, it just seemed TOO much about her. Plot holes and inconsistencies everywhere, mega eye roll moments.&&Bird Box is absolute **** doesn't work as movie in any way shape or form its stupid retarded and everything that's wrong with the world is wrong with this movie the characters are **** and also the editing is absolute **** i **** hate it. the movie starts with the only surviving characters&&

comment: All three leads are terrific — especially Vikander, whose Japanese is impressive — but they’re working with material that doesn’t measure up to their talents. Read full review&&Everyone here appears to be revelling in the juicy opportunities Earthquake Bird brings to hit up our memories of everything from Fatal Attraction to Single White Female. Read full review&&But even if this film of a Susanna Jones novel makes a middling whodunit, it’s still a fine vehicle for Vikander, an actress of quiet reserve and inner fury. She and the exotic setting lift Earthquake Bird, even if it never fully takes flight. Read full review&&Try as he might, Westmoreland can’t muster the same portraiture skills with a woman of mystery and brokenness that he’s shown with bold, expressive types (“Still Alice,” “Colette”). Read full review&&Netflix's Earthquake Bird is a not particularly engaging thriller featuring an inert performance from Alicia Vikander. Read full review&&For all its consideration, while Earthquake Bird adds up to a “real” movie, it’s too polite to add up to an entirely compelling one. Read full review&&It’s almost a romantic melodrama, but it’s emotionally inert. It’s almost a biting statement about cultural appropriation, but it barely shows its fangs. It’s almost a murder mystery, but it abandons the plot for vast periods of time. It’s almost a good film except, no, that’s really stretching it. At its best it’s an unfocused plod. Read full review&&The film is a great study of the Alicia Vikander character (Lucy), a woman who in the past suffered a great tragedy and moved to the other side of the world to escape it.

comment: A relaxed delight, a series of delicately tongue-in-cheek musings about the clash between American and French cultures. Read full review&&Captures the effervescence and playfulness of Johnson's novel, even as it attempts to shoehorn a tangle of characters and situations. Read full review&&As in other Ivory-Jhabvala adaptations, ritzy consumerism is very much on display, but what makes this better than most is Johnson's amused admiration for nearly all her characters, regardless of nationality. Read full review&&This is an insignificant film with a passably entertaining premise that goes wildly to hell the instant it strays from its comic ideals with brief, unsatisfying detours into the realms of art and high-end lingerie. Read full review&&Scattered and silly. If it evokes any strong feelings from you, it will probably be hunger -- the food all looks so good. Read full review&&Somehow lacks lightness and weight. This is a movie that tries to work a bloody suicide attempt and a murder into a comedy of manners, with almost everything registering in the same narrow spectrum of inconsequence. Read full review&&A generally mirthless comedy of manners.&&Usually when I watch a film based on a bestseller that I haven't read, I run out to buy the book. Seabiscuit is a good example. I understand how tough it is to adapt a book but this film made it look impossible. The film couldn't decide what it was about. I went in thinking that&&Horrifying little movie by someone who is probably the sort of person who still calls french fries "freedom fries." For all the eye candy on the screen, everyone manages to come off extremely ugly. Avoid.&&So loaded with feminist propaganda that every development left me in no suspense as to its purpose and outcome. Reminiscent of old Soviet movies. Excruciating.&&
