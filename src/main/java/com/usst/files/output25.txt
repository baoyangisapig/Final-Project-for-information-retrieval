It may seem unfair to ask for more depth from De Palma when his surfaces give so much pleasure, but from a director this prodigiously talented one expects miracles. Dressed to Kill takes his series of Hitchcockian homages about as far as they can go. It's exhilarating dead-end moviemaking, and one eagerly awaits his next move. [4 Aug 1980, p.61]&&Originality has never been a high value in the genre-bound aesthetic of filmmaking, but De Palma cheapens what he steals, draining the Hitchcock moves of their content and complexity. He's left with a collection of empty technical tricks—obtrusive and gimmick-crazed, this film has been “directed” within an inch of its life—and he fills in the blanks with an offhand cruelty toward his characters, a supreme contempt for his audience (at one point, we're compared to the drooling voyeurs who inhabit his vision of Bellevue), and a curdled, adolescent vision of sexuality.

comment: Take my word for it, or better yet go find out for yourself: Big Hero 6 is a treat. Read full review&&With a film this funny, exciting and visually stimulating, who cares if you know exactly what's going to happen next, and when. Read full review&&After "Frozen," Disney delivers a heart-melter. The sweet, witty main pairing focuses a potentially busy, derivative super-group tale. Stay for the sting: Big Hero 7 is practically a given. Read full review&&Without making a big deal out of it, Big Hero 6 features a shrewdly balanced and engaging group of male and female characters of various ethnic backgrounds. It'd be nice to live in a world where this wasn't worth a mention, but it is. And yet the movie belongs to the big guy. Read full review&&The most endearing character in Disney's animated superhero animated movie is a one-man Affordable Care Act. (Make that a one-robot ACA.) Read full review&&Big Hero 6 is easier to admire than to love. It veers from chipper to noisy to dark stretches where it grapples with adult-sized grief. Read full review&&Big Hero 6 even has a title that sounds like a product ordered off the takeout menu of the type of restaurant that recombines a few elements in many ways. That could work fine, if any of the ingredients were particularly flavorful.

Geeky references&&This is easily one of the top animated movies ive ever seen! These idiotic disney fanboys that are writing bad reviews dont know what they are talking about. I went with my wife and my son and we were laughing from beginning till the end. This movie was very whitty and yes has some action&&This movie looks fantastic! It's beautifully designed, rendered and animated with lots of bright colours and fun action. The voice work is first rate and the dialogue is fun. The only problem with this movie is with the story which tends to have too much melodrama.&&Big Hero 6 is a visual masterpiece which speaks accord to the recent Disney Renaissance of movies, yet to older audiences will feel somewhat shallow and uninspired, despite the clever humor and brilliant setup.The second and third act of the movie poorly utilize the first act's brilliant&&ADORABLE! How could a giant white robot with an expressionless face make someone feel better? Sometimes, presence is all that matters.&&This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.&&

title: My Kid Could Paint That
director: Amir Bar-Lev

summary: In the span of only a few months, 4-year-old Marla Olmstead rocketed from total obscurity into
international renown – and sold over $300,000 dollars worth of paintings. She was compared to
Kandinsky and Pollock, and called “a budding Picasso.” But not all of the attention was positive. From the beginning, many faulted her parents for

comment: Amir Bar-Lev's documentary is fascinating on all kinds of levels: as a movie about the nature of art, the lure and pitfalls of celebrity, and the complicated conundrums of parenting. Read full review&&Amir Bar-Lev's engrossing film is as much about the stubborn ambiguities of art, truth, meaning, and relationships as it is about the authenticity of the Olmstead oeuvre. Read full review&&Bar-Lev also explores the freakish popular appeal of child prodigies, the family dynamics that come into play when a child's celebrity and earning capacity overshadows the adults', and the remarkably conflicted and contradictory admissions drawn from Brunelli about Marla's work. Read full review&&In the last analysis, I guess it all reduces to taste and instinct. Some paintings are good, says me, or says you, and some are bad. Some paintings could be painted by a child, some couldn't be. Read full review&&Everyone involved, from Marla's defensive parents to the cynical journalists who promoted and then turned on her, seems to have some sort of agenda. Read full review&&The popular human-interest story of a child prodigy becomes an engrossing meditation on truth, media exploitation and the value of art in My Kid Could Paint That. Read full review&&My conclusion is that exploitation of a child for the sake of one's career is a shameful act. Read full review&&Fascinating...I think she painted them but I think her father eggs her on because Marla asks for his input and he looks guilty when his wife suggests a lie detector test.&&Tracing the rocky arc of an alleged child progidy and his conflicted parents, this slap at the pretensions of modern art ultimately ends in a completely unexpected place. A must-see.&&The film isn't entirely enjoyable but isn't a pain, and has an interesting story that I didn't know existed. Some of the critics are just letting their feelings about the story itself influence their rating of the film, like an oil executive rates a movie about global warming.&&The whole story is truly fascinating. I found it interesting the questions that were raised as well as the ones that weren't. To watch a situation play out where you're questioning the minds of everyone, including Amir Bar-Lev... you really want an answer, but what is that answer?&&

comment: As in a good European film, shots are allowed to breathe. The focus is on character and human emotion. At the same time, the movie shows an American concern for pace and story development. The result is the best of both worlds. Read full review&&For a filmmaker who has made his reputation with such crime thrillers as "Little Odessa" and "The Yards," James Gray reveals an unexpected gift for the mysteries of romance. Read full review&&Although Paltrow is radiant (and she nails the character’s ditzy sense of entitlement), it's Phoenix's movie. He is, once again, stupendous, and stupendous in a way he has never been before. Read full review&&The movie feels operatic at times. Tempestuous arias play on the soundtrack, and Puccini figures directly. Read full review&&Not always believable, but the film has a moody expressiveness that stays with you. Read full review&&The movie's chief value is to preserve Phoenix at the height of his wary physical grace, which recalls a young Marlon Brando. Read full review&&The only possible interest the movie will inspire in anyone comes when Paltrow flashes a breast toward the end, far too late to pump any excitement into an aggressively boring film that gurgles with self-indulgence.

I felt apprehension throughout the film as the disfunctional main character makes mistakes in his choices. I like the ending. Available through Overdrive with my libary card.&&hilarious and calculatively ambiguous..Two Lovers Two Lovers is a character driven romantic drama about a reserved guy who falls in love for two girls and is cornered in a morale conflict that he is definitely not ready for. It is surprisingly flat out hilarious and not forcibly imputed&&Good performances could not save what Siskel and Ebert used to call "the idiot plot": If one of the main characters ever failed to act like an idiot, there would be no plot. I found it depressing to watch the three main characters make one bad decision after another.&&
