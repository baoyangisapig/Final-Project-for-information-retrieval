comment: The Killers redux packs one lasting, significant, retrospective jolt of perversity that far eclipses any possible artistic intentions on the part of its creators though: the sight of future American President Ronald Reagan playing a baddie in his last film role before entering politics. Read full review&&Though Siegel's The Killers dispatches Hemingway after six unfaithful minutes, its roundabout treatment seems truest to his spirit. Read full review&&Don Siegel’s remake was hardly so well received, although it is in many respects a more vivid, streamlined, callous film. Read full review&&Though the film does not stand up to the 1946 version with Burt Lancaster, it has its own pleasures, including Marvin's rather likable role of an assassin, the exciting robbery sequence, and, of course, the villainous Reagan getting his just desserts.

Read full review&&Like its predecessor, Siegel's version is at its best while setting up the chillingly ruthless detail of the opening execution (here unnervingly set in an asylum for the blind), less satisfying when it starts providing an answer to the mysterious passivity of the victim (Cassavetes).

comment: More than just one of the best movies so far this year, it is a revolution in young-adult entertainment. Read full review&&Wickedly funny. In fact, Heathers may be the nastiest, cruelest fun you can have without actually having to study law or gird leather products. If movies were food, Heathers would be a cynic's chocolate binge. Read full review&&Daniel Waters' enormously clever screenplay blazes a trail of originality through the dead wood of the teen-comedy genre.

comment: The creativity grows like kudzu in Beauty Is Embarrassing, Neil Berkeley's enlightening and often hilarious portrait of the Los Angeles artist Wayne White. And it yields a thousand blossoms. Read full review&&Neil Berkeley's documentary is as puckish as its subject, so steeped in artist Wayne White's creative juices that it makes you want to go straight home and start making things.

Read full review&&Those with a high tolerance for the ultimate four-letter word, and a love for eccentrics, will be entertained by both White and his art. Read full review&&As one observer here aptly - and non-hyperbolically - sums it up, White is "a founding father of the current state of pop art." Read full review&&The result is an artist profile that doesn't feel like the standard, stuffy artist profile. Instead, Beauty is Embarrassing is an entertaining whimsy that, like White, never takes itself too seriously, doesn't overstay its welcome and never, ever underestimates the value of a chuckle.
