It is a masterpiece of filmic creations -- nothing quite like it before or since. [11 Dec 1992, p.C11]&&The most distinctive things about the film are possibly Caron's personae-montage at the beginning, which showcases her virtuoso dance moves, and the final fantasy sequence, which resolves (a little hurriedly) the emotional obstacles to their love. An exotically contrived romance. Read full review&&Perhaps the best thing that can be said about An American in Paris is that it led directly to the production of Singin' in the Rain. Without the former, there might not have been the latter. Gene Kelly remains one of the best and brightest of the Golden Era musical stars and An American in Paris shows him in fine form. The movie should be remembered for that quality rather than for its questionable Oscar triumph.

summary: 2001: A Space Odyssey is a countdown to tomorrow, a road map to human destiny, a quest for the infinite. To begin his voyage into the future, Kubrick visits our prehistoric ape-ancestry past, then leaps millenia (via one of the most mind-blowing jump cuts ever conceived) into colonized space, and ultimately whisks astronaut Bowman (Dullea)… Expand

comment: Beloved for many different reasons, including its scrupulous scientific accuracy, its vast reach from "The Dawn of Man" to the next stage of human evolution, its unrivaled integration of musical and visual composition, its daring paucity of dialogue and washes of silence, its astonishingly creative psychedelic sequence and its still-gorgeous pre-digital special effects.

The rest of the time is occupied with demanding, brilliant material for the eye and brain.

comment: It's a rare feat for a director whose films, from their muted humour and dated-seeming mise-en-scène, to their use of flat, unexpressive, Bressonian close-ups of characters, have always seemed weirdly outside of time. Read full review&&As a writer, Kaurismäki has a precious knack for jokes that work beautifully in any language. Read full review&&Winsome, sweet, and often very funny, The Other Side of Hope is more of the same from Kaurismäki, and thank God for that. Read full review&&Using comedy to chase away the despair of modern life, The Other Side of Hope is a thoroughly satisfying and distinctively lovable film. Read full review&&There’s nothing adorable or convoluted about this collision of worlds. The Other Side of Hope makes room for jokes about bad restaurants alongside stark monologues about the horrors of Syria. It operates in an atmosphere of constant conflicting emotions. Read full review&&While the conclusion to The Other Side of Hope is open-ended, Kaurismaki unashamedly believes in brotherhood, and among other things his film celebrates people who do the right thing without making a big deal about it. Read full review&&The Other Side of Hope fulfills the vague sense of its aspirational title as a film limited in scope and led only by the guidance of its maker's skeptical positivity. Read full review&&An asinine movie. Not a single genuine laugh or genuine emotion. The deadpan motif throughout is overdone to the point of idiocy. The movie is an insult to the real refugees of real crisis around the world. I gave it two stars because someone had to carry a camera and someone had to edit it.&&

comment: Ramsay has made more sensually rapturous films, but this may be her most formally exacting: No shot or cut here is idle or extraneous.

His performance is damn near flammable — dangerous if you get too close. Read full review&&Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission. Read full review&&You Were Never Really Here isn’t an entirely satisfying experience, and may benefit from multiple viewings, but it’s still a masterful exploration of the nasty ways repressed trauma can resurface, and how violence can become a means of excising the bruises of the past.

It's strength is of course a great cast especially Daniel Day Lewis who puts his heart into it and it was worth it since the movie offers some chilling moment and definitely has a gripping plot but it falls into bits and pieces once in a while.&&
