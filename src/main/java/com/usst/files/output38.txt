comment: The radiant Danner, one of the greats, is perfection here, while Forster gives a stunning, Oscar-worthy turn as a man struggling to hold onto a blissful past to ward off a frightening future.

comment: Instead of treating puppy love like child’s play, Blue Jay savors the fantasy of foundations built in adolescence, kindled while the heart is still young, and draws out the agonizing reality that romance ultimately fizzles out of necessity as we age and mature. Read full review&&Sarah Paulson and Mark Duplass shine in Blue Jay, a charming nostalgia trip tackling heady themes in a manner that is both lovingly awkward and brutally real. Read full review&&A gentle, genuine trip down memory lane that features one of our best actresses in the kind of role she doesn’t get to play that often, and another great turn in the arc of an independent film icon.
