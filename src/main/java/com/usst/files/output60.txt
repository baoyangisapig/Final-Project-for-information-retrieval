Some people are calling the director, Ana Lilly Amirpour, the female Tarantino. I can see why: The Bad Batch is stylish, brutal, and has a thumping good musical score.

comment: Edwards' crowning achievement. It is a wickedly funny, impeccably cast, ingeniously subversive satire of the Hollywood film industry. Read full review&&This movie has teeth, and it's not afraid to bite. [6 July 1981, p.7]&&It's a nasty, biased, self-serving movie that also happens to be hilarious most of the time. Read full review&&This is by no means the first film, nor the first film about the movie industry, in which the epitome of emotion is represented by a character talking on the telephone while oral sex is being performed on him. [3 July 1981, p.19]&&This satirical attack on Hollywood and the film industry, however, lacks the biting edge and fresh characters necessary to make it work. Read full review&&Though, like many of Edwards' films, it lurches uncertainly from slapstick farce to mordant humour in an extremely hit-or-miss fashion, this surprisingly bitter satire on Tinseltown - in which a producer (Mulligan) beefs up his latest turkey of a movie by introducing some pornographic sex scenes and having his wife/star (Andrews) bare her breasts on screen - does hit the mark once or twice.
