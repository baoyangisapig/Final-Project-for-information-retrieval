Read full review&&The picture is a devilishly clever series of reversals that keeps you guessing to the very end. Read full review&&The Spanish Prisoner resembles Alfred Hitchcock in the way that everything takes place in full view, on sunny beaches and in brightly lit rooms, with attractive people smilingly pulling the rug out from under the hero and revealing the abyss. Read full review&&The weird thing about the films David Mamet has directed is that they have about as much emotion as a cyborg in a science fiction movie, yet by the end of the picture it isn't necessary; by then the audience has supplied their own.

Read full review&&Writer-director David Mamet delights in his own supposed cleverness; he wants you to scratch your head while he manipulates your brain.

comment: Their sweet, determined, gently understated struggle for fulfillment in a superstitiously conservative society makes this densely, deftly packed movie a quiet joy to behold. Read full review&&Driver's tough core of honesty and wit is bewitching. So's the movie. Read full review&&Although there isn't anything startlingly original in this tale of three Catholic girls falling in love in late-fifties Ireland, it gets a sweet telling in Pat O'Connor's pretty film. Read full review&&Naturally charming without being beautiful, Driver brings extraordinary intensity and tenderness to a role that easily could have become sappy. Read full review&&As Benny, a small- town Irish teenager in the '50s who goes off to university in Dublin, Minnie Driver has a touchingly awkward prettiness. Her jaw may be as square as a picture frame, but her smile lights her up from within.

comment: Because of King's phenomenal popularity as a master of the comically macabre, executive producer Dino De Laurentiis has stinted on nothing to bring these tales alive. This means that the special effects are impeccable and Giorgio Postiglione's production design meticulous and inspired. Yet it's the well-drawn characters, plus the brisk, stylish direction of Teague and superb camerawork of Cardiff, that make it work. Read full review&&Cat's Eye is a slickly efficient and very funny omnibus of tongue-in-cheek menace, reminiscent of the best Twilight Zone episodes. [20 Apr 1985]&&Cat's Eye is pop movie making of an extremely clever, stylish and satisfying order. Read full review&&A far more accomplished anthology than Creepshow, Cat's Eye assumes an honorable but not exalted position in the multimedia King empire. But expect as many giggles as goose bumps. [06 May 1985, p.73]&&It all adds up to a better-than-average entertainment that sags terribly in the middle. [15 Apr 1985, p.4C]&&Stories by Stephen King are traditionally brought to the screen in the worst possible shape, so it's gratifying to report that Cat's Eye, a King trilogy, is not a terrible movie. It's not going to go down in anyone's annals, either, but it's fun and, if you like cats, ultimately quite gratifying. [17 Apr 1985, p.B5]&&A rather tepid anthology film, CAT'S EYE is a pastiche of leftover Stephen King notions, connected by a ubiquitous cat that ominously appears to set off each tale. Read full review&&Solid performance by Drew Barrymore, and great sense of humor. I'm a little surprised that the critics were on board for this one, frankly. Not one of King's best.&&In this film, based on short stories by Stephen King, three stories intertwine through the same cat. The idea seems good and, in fact, its an interesting way to bring to the cinema stories that, alone, don't justify a feature length. The big problem with the film is that it doesn't&&

comment: LaLoggia shares his unique vision with the viewer through an imaginative and innovative visual style that flows skillfully from traditional naturalism into surreal dreamlike fantasies and back again without ever seeming gratuitous or clumsy. A remarkable film. Read full review&&Here are the bones of an ordinary ghost story. But the writer and director Frank LaLoggia brings them to life with exceptional vitality. Read full review&&Although the results are a bit overextended, the film is still something of a rarity nowadays: an evocative, poetic horror film without a trace of gore (and in this respect, closer to a Val Lewton film of the 40s like The Curse of the Cat People than any contemporary models).

comment: Though its generic title may evoke memories of the archaic science videos you fell asleep to in grade school, Schwartzberg’s film quickly proves to be one of the year’s most mind-blowing, soul-cleansing and yes, immensely entertaining triumphs. Read full review&&The totality of Fantastic Fungi is so entertaining, informative and appealingly hopeful about the hard-working cure-all for our ailing world lying beneath our feet. Read full review&&It’s heady stuff, and Brie Larson’s gentle narration helps you navigate this quite complex topic. Read full review&&This movie is fascinating on a lot of levels. Read full review&&“Focuses” is a relative term for a documentary that dispenses lots of information without organizing it very well, but Fantastic Fungi is never uninteresting, and often startling in the natural beauty it reveals.

comment: This debut marks a bright future for Vives and is an excellent entry in the romantic comedy format that doesn’t lose sight of who its heroine is the moment she falls for someone. Read full review&&While the character’s resulting journey of self-discovery may follow familiar lines, it is bracing nevertheless. Read full review&&Both bleakly humorous and laugh out loud funny, the brilliant All About Nina is a powerful film about the importance of women’s voices, and the change that can come from telling your story. Read full review&&while All About Nina does not add anything new to this genre, writer-director Eva Vives’ film does benefit from the female perspective. It also showcases a fearless performance from Winstead. Read full review&&All About Nina works best as a showcase for Winstead, even if she’s performing material we’ve already heard before. Read full review&&Mary Elizabeth Winstead made a magnificent drunk in “Smashed,” so it should be no surprise that she kills as a stand-up comic in All About Nina. Read full review&&The laughs are few and slow in coming, and you’re not five minutes into the film before you know why. Despite a lively performance by Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Nina is a big bore with a small talent and a one-track mind. Read full review&&Powerful and moving, Mary Elizabeth Winstead brings a depth of emotion and raw rage to her performance. Possibly one of the most important films of the year, we need more films shining spotlights like this one.&&Go see this movie for Mary Elizabeth Winstead's performance alone. The movie is good, but she elevates it to levels beyond what must have been on the page. She deserves an Oscar for it.&&I am a huge fan of Mary Elizabeth Winstead so I was looking forward to watching this when it popped up on Netflix. I am however not a fan at all of stand up "comedy" so when the film started with several minutes of an utterly disgusting stand up routine it was time to switch it off. Ms.&&
