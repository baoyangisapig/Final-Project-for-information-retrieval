Giggle, giggle. Read full review&&It's passable. Read full review&&I loved this movie. It was great! Had so many hilarious moments, great action, and I loved how they brought them out of water. That new scenery was great! I greatly recommend seeing this movie.Once upon a time there was a fat stupid pink idiot. The end.That had me cracking! You gotta&&thi is a good movie cant lie the animation is the best ive seen and the cgi is more on focus with the cartoon part of spongebob and also there is a refrence to flanders in the credits overall the movie is so much comedy and i love it&&Spongebob has been a long-running series for more than 10 years now, and it doesn't seem to have any sign of stopping just yet. If you thought this would be a continuation for the 1st movie, think again. In fact, anybody who has never watch the series could get in touch with the characters&&If you want The Spongebob Movie (the original), then don't watch this film. This movie is more like an expanded rendition of the original Spongebob TV episodes, rather than a film format. The plot doesn't speak otherwise, but this spin on the "Plankton steals the KP formula" formula is sure&&Thankfully, The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water is a really fun time. It captures the original spirit of the show and maybe in the could end up being a cult classic, especially for stoners. Smartly written and filled with multiple gut busting one liners, this is a movie that can be&&They advertise the movie as 'sponge out of water' and show the live action stuff, but in reality they're only on land for about 20-25% of the movie, the rest is all still cartoons and underwater. Nevertheless, still funny and stayed true to the spongebob style. I just wish they'd advertised&&This would be without a doubt the worst movie I have ever taken my kids to. Even they were bored and wanted to leave half way through. I dozed through it and my wife fell asleep 15 min into it. Given the calibre of movies coming out, Im stunned this is even being screened.

summary: What are the odds of getting even? Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and the gang would have only one reason to pull off their most ambitious and riskiest casino heist -- to defend one of their own. But they're going to need more than luck on their side to break The Bank. [Warner Bros.]

comment: In a world ruled by process, is compassion still real? Or is it just another scam? In Ocean's Thirteen, it is deviously, and merrily, both. Read full review&&As smooth as a good mojito, as stylish as an Armani suit and as meaningful in the grand scheme of things as yesterday's Las Vegas betting odds, Ocean's Thirteen"continues the breezy good times of the first two series entries without missing a beat. Read full review&&The lack of explosions and gunfire makes this an atypical summer thriller, but its breezy brand of unforced and occasionally self-referential entertainment is a lot more fun than pirates, webslingers, and green ogres. Read full review&&This time, in a clever script by Brian Koppelman & David Levien (who wrote the poker drama "Rounders"), the heist is for friendship. Read full review&&Ocean's Thirteen proceeds with insouciant dialogue, studied casualness, and a lotta stuff happening, none of which I cared much about because the movie doesn't pause to develop the characters, who are forced to make do with their movie-star personas. Read full review&&The pleasures of Ocean's Thirteen are so slight as to be eminently forgettable. Most of the "twists" in the plot are of the ho-hum variety; it's not that one sees them coming, but that they don't amount to much when they show up.

These breezy doings are mustier than a Glitter Gulch casino at 4 a.m. Read full review&&Another great sequel by Steven Soderbergh to the previous ones. An execllent presentation.&&After a disappointing Ocean's 12, 13 retains the charm and fun of the original.&&really good movie. Much better than the previous sequel (the worst one in my opinion). This movie came close to the level of the first (which is the best). It was genuinely clever, had a good plot and it was a lot of fun to watch.&&Better than Twelve not as good as Eleven. The guys did a competent job with a focused, sometimes funny movie, but the spark is gone. I wouldn't go to watch Fourteen (if there will be one) unless it got great, great reviews across the board.&&Not bad. Definitely better than Ocean's Twelve (but what wasn't?), but certainly short of Ocean's Eleven. Thirteen has the charm and (relative to Twelve) is more neatly wound, but the problem is that, like Twelve (and unlike Eleven), the heist just isn't that clever.&&It is such a shame seeing so many great actors fail because of a bad script. the main reason everybody loved oceans eleven is because while your watching the movie you think your figuring the out plan, but when it all unfolds your left with a series of final events that leave you shocked&&Boring.&&
