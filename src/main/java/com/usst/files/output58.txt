summary: What are the odds of getting even? Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and the gang would have only one reason to pull off their most ambitious and riskiest casino heist -- to defend one of their own. But they're going to need more than luck on their side to break The Bank. [Warner Bros.]

comment: In a world ruled by process, is compassion still real? Or is it just another scam? In Ocean's Thirteen, it is deviously, and merrily, both. Read full review&&As smooth as a good mojito, as stylish as an Armani suit and as meaningful in the grand scheme of things as yesterday's Las Vegas betting odds, Ocean's Thirteen"continues the breezy good times of the first two series entries without missing a beat. Read full review&&The lack of explosions and gunfire makes this an atypical summer thriller, but its breezy brand of unforced and occasionally self-referential entertainment is a lot more fun than pirates, webslingers, and green ogres. Read full review&&This time, in a clever script by Brian Koppelman & David Levien (who wrote the poker drama "Rounders"), the heist is for friendship. Read full review&&Ocean's Thirteen proceeds with insouciant dialogue, studied casualness, and a lotta stuff happening, none of which I cared much about because the movie doesn't pause to develop the characters, who are forced to make do with their movie-star personas. Read full review&&The pleasures of Ocean's Thirteen are so slight as to be eminently forgettable. Most of the "twists" in the plot are of the ho-hum variety; it's not that one sees them coming, but that they don't amount to much when they show up. Read full review&&See it if you must, but don't forget to pack the Air Wick. These breezy doings are mustier than a Glitter Gulch casino at 4 a.m. Read full review&&Another great sequel by Steven Soderbergh to the previous ones. An execllent presentation.&&After a disappointing Ocean's 12, 13 retains the charm and fun of the original.&&really good movie. Much better than the previous sequel (the worst one in my opinion). This movie came close to the level of the first (which is the best). It was genuinely clever, had a good plot and it was a lot of fun to watch.&&Better than Twelve not as good as Eleven. The guys did a competent job with a focused, sometimes funny movie, but the spark is gone. I wouldn't go to watch Fourteen (if there will be one) unless it got great, great reviews across the board.&&Not bad. Definitely better than Ocean's Twelve (but what wasn't?), but certainly short of Ocean's Eleven. Thirteen has the charm and (relative to Twelve) is more neatly wound, but the problem is that, like Twelve (and unlike Eleven), the heist just isn't that clever.&&It is such a shame seeing so many great actors fail because of a bad script. the main reason everybody loved oceans eleven is because while your watching the movie you think your figuring the out plan, but when it all unfolds your left with a series of final events that leave you shocked&&Boring.&&

comment: Scrupulously fair-minded yet deliciously ambiguous, What Alice Found, a triumph of sound psychological and artistic judgment, is an unexpected treat for sophisticated audiences. Read full review&&In the end, the camper-lot prostitution serves as trapping for a weirdly touching coming-of-age film that leaves its heroine sadder but wiser. Read full review&&A small, finely wrought drama. Read full review&&Bell forces us to see characters from the proverbial wrong side of the tracks in a distinctly human light, neither ennobling nor pitying. Read full review&&By turns disarmingly amusing and dramatically blunt. Read full review&&Digital video is both the blessing and the curse of writer-director A. Dean Bell's well-conceived but underachieved What Alice Found. Read full review&&Alice has all the emotional truth of an America’s Most Wanted reenactment. Read full review&&
