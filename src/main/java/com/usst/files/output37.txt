comment: Lusciously revealing fly-on-the-wall portrait of Anna Wintour. Read full review&&A splendid study of the forces and passions behind the world’s biggest fashion magazine. Read full review&&What comes across is that she is, after all, a very good editor. Read full review&&A slight, if often riveting, behind-the-scenes documentary. Read full review&&Consistent with her ice queen reputation, Wintour is often disconcertingly direct and frequently unfeeling, though not without a dry sense of humor. Read full review&&Behind the gloss of Vogue, a revealing look at work, creativity and two strong women Read full review&&The September Issue fixates on status and professional one-upmanship; if you want to see a movie that actually treats fashion as personal expression--in other words, art--keep a lookout for Anne Fontaine’s forthcoming biopic "Coco Before Chanel."

It's the less cynical side of The Devil Wears Prada (2006) but still highly entertaining.&&It's a pretty straightforward take on closing a magazine issue, albeit in this instance a rather special issue of a rather special magazine, to put it mildly.

summary: In the middle of the Great Depression, when an America in the grips of a devastating economic downturn was nearly brought to its knees, there came along a most unlikely hero who had crowds cheering on their feet as he proved just how hard a man would fight to win a second chance for his family and himself.

comment: At last, his (Howard's) first great (and filling) movie--inspirational, yes, but far from hokey; moving, absolutely, but never saccharine; and gripping, despite its being a fixed fight. Read full review&&Ron Howard and Russell Crowe bring the Braddock story to vivid life in a superbly acted, beautifully shot, highly engaging drama that ranks as one of Howard's best efforts. Read full review&&A broad, foursquare piece of populist filmmaking that happens to be tremendously moving. Read full review&&Howard manipulates audiences without guile, jerking tears, piling on catastrophes, smoothing out dissonances, making bad characters badder and good ones gooder--and clearly believing that this is wholesome. At what he does, he's peerless. I wish I had more respect for what he does--and for myself the next morning for surrendering. Read full review&&Despite the tale's dusty pedigree, Ron Howard spins a ticket-worthy two-plus hours of movie-movie entertainment. Read full review&&Overlong and unevenly paced, Cinderella Man hits stretches (especially between bouts) when it threatens to lose its audience. Read full review&&Cinderella Man is ostensibly the kind of old-fashioned drama that sends audiences home with a satisfied glow. But like so many of Howard's movies, there's something canned and phony about it -- it left me feeling cooked and dehydrated, as if I'd fallen asleep on a tanning bed.

comment: The way I Went Down, with its lovely score, plays out under Breathnach's gentle, compassionate touch becomes wryly amusing, ironic and entirely satisfying. Its cast is a glory, adept at setting off a sly humor with a touch of pathos, and it brings to the fore Brendan Gleeson, so good in so many supporting parts, as a seriocomic powerhouse in the central role. [1 July 1998, p.F4]&&It's not the plot--however enjoyable--that makes I Went Down so successful as a genre piece. Rather, it is the assortment of quirky and nicely-defined characters who crop up along the way, along with some of the sharpest screen dialogue you're likely to hear anytime soon. [1 July 1998, p.2]&&Director Breathnach is in no hurry to pump up the action in this easygoing, episodic on-the-road adventure, and the slow pace may wear thin for some viewers. More than anything, I Went Down is a cleverly observed character study of two losers who find they suddenly stand a chance at winning. Read full review&&The accents are thick, but if you listen closely you'll be well rewarded with smart, wry humor, peculiar but likable characters and a story that while slow in spots is altogether intriguing. [1 July 1989, p.E6]&&I Went Down owes much of its novelty to steering clear of Irish movie stereotypes and instead showing off a spare and quizzical indie spirit. Read full review&&While never scaling any great heights, there's lots of little points - and some bigger ones, like the pairing of the leads - to enjoy. Read full review&&"Down" is in many respects a quite modest achievement. While several of his characters are colorful enough to elicit laughs (the sweet but bland hero, I'm afraid, isn't one of them), Breathnach takes a perilously long time to generate narrative excitement and delivers only a pint-sized dramatic payoff.
