comment: It’s relatively good. Of course, “relatively good” in the mid-‘80s teen-movie genre often means “not unwatchable,” and Secret Admirer doesn’t quite qualify as fresh or unpredictable...But it also has a handful of gratifying moments and nuances you don’t expect from the genre, starting with girls who eat and curse like boys. Read full review&&The first 20 minutes owe too much - much too much - to Animal House & Co., and the last 20 to The Graduate, but in between there is an uproariously crude and vigorously funny effort to squish the teen genre into the confines of classic French sex farce.[14 June 1985]&&Secret Admirer is a cut above the usual teen sex comedy, which is sort of like Caspar Weinberger saying, "Six hundred bucks, sure, but it was a heckuva ashtray." Read full review&&To Greenwalt's credit as cowriter, there are funny lines and some situations that held promise. But his direction is early "Brady Bunch," with a daub of Ridley Scott's Chanel commercials for further inspiration...Despite the director, the cast is decent, with Fred Ward of the "Right Stuff" in rare comic form as Lt. Lou Fimple, a vice cop who finds both his wife and his daughter undone on lover's lane.

For the rest, the characters are rather less memorable than the Pepsi cans, Fruit Loops and other brand name junk foods looming large in the foreground of almost every frame. Read full review&&To be fair, Secret Admirer is somewhat more clever and a great deal sweeter than the standard for its damp genre. Those who remember with affection Archie's constant flailings at Veronica with the help of lovesick Betty will feel on familiar ground here. The outcome seems fixed almost from the opening moments, and the fact that lonesome Toni, who is made out to be the wallflower, is considerably more attractive than the horsy Debora Anne ("the most beautiful girl in school") is only the first of many tip-offs.

And as more and more lumpy young pectorals are flashed, more and more people and objects are exploded. All this is accompanied by a persistently obnoxious soundtrack that features patriotic fanfares.

comment: More story-led than the original with a high enough body count to make it a satisfying action movie. Read full review&&The picture hurtles along, smoothly if not plausibly, and saves some surprises for the last reel. The Predator, it seems, represents that part of the human spirit that responds with pleasure when violence breaks out, whether it is in Central America, the inner city, or the suburban multiplex playing Predator 2. [21 Nov 1990, p.3C]&&Virtually everything about the film is derivative--even the design for the eerie setting for the climactic struggle recalls the interiors of the more exotic old movie palaces--but its makers can't be accused of cutting corners. No doubt about it, those who ask only for pure action will be getting their money's worth. Read full review&&Almost all of its screen time is taken up with explosions, chases, shootouts, heads coming off, folks getting sliced in half -- and the odd thing about it is that after 40 minutes, it's not disturbing anymore. Just dull. [21 Nov 1990, p.E1]&&It's shoot-em-up action from start to finish, beginning at such a peak that there's hardly any room for the action to build or climax. Read full review&&The dumbest, goriest bone-cruncher of the season: an unnecessary and Arnold-less sequel to the Schwarzenegger science-fiction hit of three years ago. [21 Nov 1990, p.C3]&&The whole noisy movie is really just a setup for the climactic duel between renegade cop Danny Glover and the monster. By that point, you’re pathetically grateful for a few stomach-churning special effects.

Absolutely Fantastic!&&I can't understand why this film got so many flacks and I watched the first movie. I found the main character charismatic and the Predator terrifying, I was captivated by the story and action. I think that the main reason why this movie put off many fans of the original is because its tone&&It's okay. Not as good than the first one, but it's enjoyable, with good deaths, special effects and a convincing Danny Glover.&&Okay, This Is Just Weird
A Predator in a city!?, That is kinda ridiculous and funny at the same time.&&Is kinda entertaining but mostly extremely mediocre. Glover is good but the predators should keep their masks on.&&Predator 2 is the sequel to 1987's Predator.. The original Predator movie from 1987 starring Arnold Schwarzenegger was great but the ending was daft but still a great film and sci fi classic. Predator 2 is set in Los Angeles and is set in a warzone between cops and criminals and Jamaican&&
