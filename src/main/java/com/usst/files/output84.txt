comment: I like the way McLeod handles the genre. The easiest thing to do would be for her to write Feore’s Elon Musk-y space-or-bust character as a villain, thus making it impossible not to root for her protagonist (who warns of a potential load-bearing problem with the space-plane’s runway).

comment: Proving it’s still possible to stick to the broad contours of “The Graduate” story and come up with something brightly endearing, 5 to 7 is a memorable directorial debut for “Mad Men” writer Victor Levin.

The picture has the gentle, nourishing quality of a fairy tale that you want to believe, and the unsoftened impact of gut-level entertainment. [13 July 1990, Daily Datebook, p.E1]&&It’s soppy and sentimental, and it’s no longer possible to take the famous pottery sequence seriously, but some neat special effects and a healthy dose of humour prevent it from becoming mawkish. Read full review&&One of the irritations of Ghost is that the Moore character is such a slow study. Read full review&&There's something relentlessly superficial about the movie, and in one area that cries out for sensitivity - the treatment of racial differences among the characters - it falls down badly. [22 Aug 1990, Arts, p.11]&&It's formula-packed business as usual. In fact, it's double-packed, triple-packed, more. Read full review&&In all his athletic scenes, leaping through doors, leaping between uptown and downtown trains, leaping on an assortment of villains, Swayze is just fine. It's the movie's big cosmic questions that throw him; for these he's reduced to a look of total stupefaction--not the movie's finest moments. [13 July 1990, Calendar, p.F-1]&&A bad movie that a lot of people will like... Though director Jerry Zucker wants his necrophiliac romance to be sensitive, he pumps up its feelings fortissimo so the dimmest viewer will get the point. [16 July 1990, p.86]&&This is one of the best movies that I have ever seen. Excellent characters. Perfect plot. Not a single mistake. Ingenious. Masterly. Beautifully. Exciting&&This Is Another Great Movie It's One Of The Best Whoopi Goldberg Movies That I Ever Seen This Movies Stars Whoopi Goldberg, Demi Moore And Patrick Swayze It's About Patrick Swayze Who Lives With Demi Moore And Then All Of A Sudden Patrick Swayze Becomes A Ghost After He Died By A Murder He&&A beautiful movie with a touching story and an incredible cast. Whooping Goldberg made me laugh during this movie and she dilivered an awesome performance. Patrick Swayze is my man crush.&&What we have in 'Ghost" is a film with many brilliant performances, an interesting, intriguing but often bumpy plot which is often full of unexplained queries and questionable motives, and a romantic burst so powerful and heavy that it has all the makings of a tragic fairytale. Tragic being&&Ghost, especially the clay scene, is painfully cheesy. But the feel of the whole movie and the way it plays out is inspiring, even if the setup has been done a hundred times before.&&you'll go to heaven..

Ghost

An interesting idea to project a concept that is clearly dark into a suave romance and good old drama with great music and moments which reminds you of the old romantic novels that plays its major part on the metaphorical emotions.&&This ultra-romantic film addresses two main themes: the power of love and the afterlife. The title may deceive, make us think that is another horror film about hauntings. Well ... it's about ghosts but does not scare anyone. The script is based on the sudden death of Sam and in his attempts&&

comment: Striking an effective balance between suspenseful intrigue and wacky humour, director Marshall handles both the spy-jinks and Goldberg's eccentric antics with confident panache. There are occasions when Goldberg does rather too much, arresting the action by lapsing into stand-up comic routines; fortunately, the plot soon regains its brisk momentum. Read full review&&Penny Marshall proves deft at blending the silly stuff with enough action to generate a bit of suspense; the mix is that of Beverly Hills Cop. And the script, though the work of a whole crowd -- almost always a bad sign -- has marvelous moments. [10 Oct 1986, p.D1]&&Whoopi Goldberg can make you laugh and make you cry, and she's attractive and kind of come-hithery in her own bug-eyed way. [10 Oct 1986, p.D1]&&It's Whoopi Goldberg, however, who gives you something extraordinary. At the center of all this formula tongue-in-cheek thriller pablum, she keeps sending out weird curves and bent splinters of off-center energy. She's a remarkably empathic actress, and you only hope she'll get a few vehicles that push her to the limit. Read full review&&Whoopi Goldberg is the only original or interesting thing about Jumpin' Jack Flash. And she tries, but she's not enough. Read full review&&The idea is funnier than the execution. Miss Goldberg is only funny when she is being foul-mouthed, which seems rude since no one else is allowed to respond in kind or degree. Read full review&&Jumpin' Jack Flash is not a gas, it's a bore. A weak idea and muddled plot poorly executed not surprisingly results in a tedious film with only a few brief comic interludes from Whoopi Goldberg to redeem it. Read full review&&
