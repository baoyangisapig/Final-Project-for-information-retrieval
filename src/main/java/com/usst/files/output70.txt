And, like a lot of the old B movies, those cheap thrillers of the 1940s and 1950s, Point Break has considerably more raw energy than almost all of the higher-priced products. [12 July 1991, p.3F]&&Point Break, though it's anything but watertight where plotting is concerned, again reveals Ms. Bigelow's real talents as a director of fast-paced, high-adrenaline action. Whenever the flakiness of Point Break threatens to become lulling, Ms. Bigelow wakes up her audience with a formidable jolt. Read full review&&Point Break points up inherent limitations in the "star" rating system. Its purely visceral material (surf sounds, skydiving stunt work, a tough indoor shootout midway through) are first-rate. As for the tangibles that matter even more (script, acting, directorial control, credible relationships between characters), Break defies belief. Dramatically, it rivals the lowest surf yet this year. [12 July 1991, p.4D]&&Point Break has its areas of excitement, but on too many occasions the movie just lies there -- even when it does, however, the film still manages to look and sound good. Read full review&&Bigelow stages the film's action sequences with a brutal efficiency (they almost redeem the movie), but she can't keep the increasingly silly script in check. Read full review&&Whatever raffish charm Reeves and Swayze exhibit is lost in the superficial gloss of Iliff's screenplay and Bigelow's direction. [12 July 1991, p.7]&&Point Break is a great action film with stunning practical action sequences that are exciting to watch with characters and dialogue that is very memorable

comment: It's a glamorous revenge romp, a "9 to 5" mixed with "Auntie Mame," and it gives each star the opportunity to do her best work in a long, long time. Read full review&&And thanks to great existential one-liners from scriptwriter Robert Harling (with appropriate plaudits to novelist Olivia Goldsmith, of course), gender warfare is made amusing for almost everyone. Read full review&&It's funnier, and bitchier, than Clare Boothe Luce's "The Women," and, best of all, it showcases three wonderful actresses who have rarely been better. Read full review&&Yet with so much going for it, the film's creators have made the classic Hollywood choice and treated its actresses like flesh-and-blood special effects. If you've got talent like this, or so the theory goes, a coherent story is a luxury that can be dispensed with.

comment: A prime example of a solid romantic comedy. Read full review&&Prime serves as yet another showcase for Streep; to prove how expertly she plays a Jewish mother with a Ph.D. in psychology, just imagine Barbra Streisand in the role -- you'd have a farce only a step above slapstick. With Streep, you get a smartly observant comedy that never overplays its hand. Read full review&&Despite the snappy brilliance of the setup, Prime doesn't entirely deliver on its promise -- something about the way it ends feels like a cop-out, and the opportunities for humor aren't exploited quite as well as they could be. Read full review&&All of this makes the movie pleasant, but not very memorable - a pale mirror image of "Shopgirl," which touches on some similar themes. Read full review&&Greenberg and Thurman are both engaging, but they can't quite compensate for their characters' shallowness. Streep, on the other hand, just can't stop compensating. Her oy-vey-can-you-believe-the-kid-and-his-shiksa performance is all studied mannerisms with no real heart. Read full review&&The occasionally amusing, generally fatuous romantic comedy about a dazzling divorcee, a smitten Jewish boy and a controlling Jewish mom who also happens to be the divorcee's psychotherapist, is a high-concept movie with a Yiddish accent. Read full review&&It has the low-budget look and feel of an indie dating comedy -- and not a very good one at that. Read full review&&My wife and I both tremendously enjoyed this movie. We agreed it's as strong as "Annie Hall". I was surprised to read that Sandra Bullock originally was to appear in the Uma Thurman role. I think that would've been a big mistake. Miss Thurman brought so much heart to this movie.&&I really enjoyed this one. Often, these movies are cute but boring, but this one was witty and entertaining. I thoroughly enjjoyed it.&&A real treat. Interesting three-dimensional, real characters with genuine flaws. Not tied up with a neat little bow at the end. It was marketed as a "romantic comedy," but that's selling it short, because genre branding has become such a pejorative. It has some very, very funny moments&&Very light & enjoyable; great cast. Believable. Streep is always good. Although we've seen it before, the family being Jewish adds a nice layer of humor to the movie. A fresh take on an old premise.&&Uma and Streep both are wonderful. Yes the plot drags a little, and there are points in the movie where you'd fastforward if you had a remote to the movie screen. However, it remains overall a funny and heartfelt movie. The ending is perfect for this movie and it really touched me.&&Since I'm actually IN a relationship that began like this (6 years and counting) - I was looking forward to Prime, and ended up pretty disappointed. Lots of serious issues oversimplified in favor of Jewish shtick (and I AM Jewish, but enough is enough already).&&Meryl, Meryl, Meryl - what were you thinking? The tiny little inside jokes were just that - tiny and litte, and should say outside - not in my favorite movie house. I'd rather eat popcorn on the curb!&&
