comment: Sleek, moody, violent and romantic, Sharky's Machine is not only the most seductive Burt Reynolds movie in many a moon. Reynolds is turning into a stylish director, and he sets a distinctive tone of languid menace. Though he can be graphically brutal, Reynolds isn't after realism, but a kind of gauzy, slightly baroque romanticism. [28 Dec 1981, p.64]&&Sharky’s Machine contains all of the ingredients of a tough, violent, cynical big-city cop movie, but what makes it intriguing is the way the Burt Reynolds character plays against those conventions. Read full review&&Mr. Reynolds's third and best directorial effort - the first two were Gator and The End - is an unexpectedly accomplished cop thriller. There is, as is often the case with movies of that genre, less here than meets the eye: the plot has its unreasonable spots, and the story doesn't come to much in the end. But one measure of the success of Sharky's Machine is that it's too fast and exciting for those considerations to count until after the movie is over. Read full review&&Burt Reynolds stars as a Dirty Harry-style detective who chases after a high-powered pimp in Atlanta. When Reynolds stays in character, the film works well as a straight thriller. When he winks at the audience with his dialog, the film falls apart. [25 Dec 1981, p.12]&&Unfortunately, Reynolds the director is as uncertain about the tone of the picture as Reynolds the star is about his screen persona. So while the action veers from lightweight action to extreme violence, Reynolds' character vacillates between macho tough guy and sensitive, vulnerable leading man. Read full review&&Burt Reynolds showed signs of becoming a very personal filmmaker with this police thriller, his third outing as a director. It has the wistful faith in innocence and the extreme moral outrage of Gator coupled with the subversive infantilism of The End; what Reynolds lacks in technique (which is plenty) is nearly compensated for by the almost embarrassing intensity of his feelings. The context is extremely violent, which makes the intimate moments—between Reynolds and the girl and Reynolds and his buddies—stand out in agonizingly stark relief.

comment: The gamble of casting Misses Tomlin and Fonda in what would seem to be the wrong roles (Violet is the strong, efficient, hard-edged secretary; Judy the frilly, "feminine," inexperienced employee) pays off handsomely, especially with Miss Tomlin. When she is handed a memo by a senior secretary and smilingly snarls, "Thanks, Roz, I know just where to stick it," her line reading is worth the price of admission. The pneumatic Miss Parton sings the theme song with greater confidence than she brings to her acting: she is a sweet little thing, but she's no thespian. [20 Dec 1980]&&Anyone who has ever worked in an office will be able to identify with the antics in Nine to Five. Although it can probably be argued that Patricia Resnick and director Colin Higgins' script [from a story by Resnick] at times borders on the inane, the bottom line is that this picture is a lot of fun.&&Nine to Five is a good-hearted, simple-minded comedy that will win a place in film history, I suspect, primarily because it contains the movie debut of Dolly Parton. She is, on the basis of this one film, a natural-born movie star, a performer who holds our attention so easily that it's hard to believe it's her first film.

As a comedy built on the juicy soil of revenge, "9 to 5" falls between two poles. It's not wild or dark enough to qualify as a truly disturbing farce and it's too fanciful and silly to succeed as realistic satire. Politically and esthetically, it's harmless--a mildly amusing romp that tends to get swallowed up by its own overly intricate plot.

Jones, a former Playgirl nude centerfold whose only previous film role was the husband of Bo Derek in 10, lumbers vacantly through the part of Flash Gordon with the naivete, fearlessness, and dopey line readings familiar from the 1930s serials.

Read full review&&Cross may not earn the broad recognition he deserves for his performance in It's a Disaster, a droll apocalypse comedy of exceedingly modest scale and even more modest commercial appeal. But it's still a master class in how to play the straight man right. Read full review&&Audiences may not care about this gang when the party starts, but once the dust settles, you’ve gotta admit, they made for pretty good company. Read full review&&Quirky, funny and a little claustrophobic (by design), it’s confident enough in what it’s trying to accomplish to take the chance on the title. And what he’s trying to accomplish is ambitious. Read full review&&The film flirts with big ideas about adult relationships, but fails to locate any gravitas about its characters' existential or psychological crises. Read full review&&Berger’s script is little more than a series of contrived comic vignettes that prevent the actors from creating believable characters, forcing them to contort to fit the low-rent farce. Read full review&&Funny and entertaining movie, it was an unexpected surprise. Took me half the movie to get Tobias Funke out of my head.&&This movie is streaming on Netflix, perfect place to see it. I probably would have liked it a lot less if I'd spent money on it. But it was a great Friday night movie with my significant other. Lots of laughs in the movie, mixed with relationship issues that everyone has encountered one time&&A solid script and overall good performances that made me laugh several times leads to a mild recommendation. You do wonder if you would act remotely the way these characters do in their situation. My guess not likely.&&

comment: As heist films go, Radford has crafted an engaging, if not especially memorable one, with Flawless. Read full review&&It's assured and neatly crafted - the time zips by while you're watching it. Read full review&&In the diamond-heist thriller Flawless, there aren't a lot of diamonds, heists or thrills. But there is a nice sense of style, and appreciation for tense face-to-face confrontations among characters trying to ignore the temptations around them. Read full review&&The heist in Flawless comes at the film's midpoint, but although Radford wrings some nice suspense from the sequence, the theft isn't his primary focus here. It's what happens next. Read full review&&Polished but oddly lifeless heist thriller. Read full review&&A mildly diverting period heist movie. Read full review&&Flawless is the sort of movie that tends to get called "enjoyably old-fashioned," except that there's nothing enjoyable about it. The pacing is torpid, the plotting slack, and the performances utterly joyless--chiefly Moore, who walks through every scene with her face stretched into an expressionless mask, her lips pressed into a permanent pout. Read full review&&A gem. Flawless is a heist movie where the motives are more complicated than the usual "it's all about the money." The very human thieves, Moore and Caine, have believable human reasons for doing it. And they sweat bullets in the process. When they pull it off you're more thrilled&&There isn't much going on here, and contrary to the title, Flawless is definitely flawed. The performances are surprisingly bland, and the story is, too. There isn't much heist, diamonds, or interesting characters here; just a movie that has some style and multiple clichés.&&Un vioque et une cougar s'associent pour monter un casse audacieux et pas forcément désagréable à regarder grâce bien évidemment à la présence de Michael Caine. Demi Moore quant à elle ne convainc qu'à moitié comme trop souvent, hélas !Le scénario et la réalisation se révèlent solides&&With an interesting premise, plus Michael Caine and Demi Moore, Flawless should have been set up for success. Nevertheless, it falls flat on its face.&&

comment: The movie's title might sound like a splatter-fest by Rob Zombie. But despite the theme, “Eddie” goes easy on gratuitous gore. What we get is a cerebral horror movie and a satire of the art world. Read full review&&Beneath the surface outrageousness lies a surprisingly, satisfyingly dark little fable about the essentially cannibalistic nature of artistic inspiration. Read full review&&While secret handshakes are amusingly depicted as the key to building trust and friendship, it's Stephen McHattie's greedy agent...that truly hammers home the film's depiction of the art world as fueled by rapacious, kill-or-be-killed bloodlust. Read full review&&This witty first feature is a flawed but diverting meditation on finding inspiration while losing your soul. Read full review&&It winds up as little more than a mildly fun spatter picture that will be best enjoyed by undemanding patrons at midnight screenings. Read full review&&Because the film clearly aims for satire, Boris Rodriguez isn't entirely guilty of indulging gruesome spectacle for its own sake. Read full review&&The holes in the plot, not in Eddie’s diet, are the real joke. Read full review&&

comment: A darkly stylish horror film. Read full review&&On balance, however, there are more things to like about Daybreakers than to dislike. The production is loaded with impressive touches, some more nuanced than others. Read full review&&While the characters are B-movie thin, the dialogue standard-issue, and the CG and matte effects only passable at best, it's undeniable fun to behold the likes of serious thespians Hawke and Dafoe slumming around in this cheeseball stuff. Read full review&&Possibly the least sexy vampire flick ever to crawl out of the crypt (it never occurs to anyone that biting someone's neck is kinda intimate; the act is strictly utilitarian), but it's unusually detailed in its imagining. Read full review&&The idea goes only so far--roughly halfway through the 98-minute running time--in staining narrative clarity. Daybreakers finally comes up with some comments on the predatory practices of Big Pharma, but that's an awful comedown from the blood-rushing brilliance of the early scenes. Read full review&&Wearisome "Ain't it cool?" video-game splatter-violence is all that's memorable of the action, while a (mixed) metaphorical subtext of conservationism can't save a text that squanders its actors. Read full review&&Any higher intentions are brought crashing down by predictability, wooden characters, giggle-inducing attempts at scares (shrieking bats, anyone?) and cinematography so gloomy it should be checked for serotonin deficiency. Read full review&&I can't believe all the nitpicking about this movie. I initially did not go to see this because of what I read. I thought it was a very interesting story....a new twist for a vampire story. It was very well done from start to finish.......quality acting, well known and interesting&&I wanted to see a real vampire movie because of the Twilight invasion. And I loved it. Very hard to pick out what's bad about this movie. Finally no more embarrassing sparkly skin when in the sun.

comment: In Michael Winterbottom's Trishna, Thomas Hardy's Victorian romantic tragedy "Tess of the D'Urbervilles" proves surprisingly adaptable to contemporary India. Read full review&&With Trishna, his (Winterbottom) penchant for risks has once again paid off. Read full review&&Trishna is in love with India without romanticizing it. Read full review&&The ever-versatile Winterbottom's loose and limber adaptation doesn't entirely mesh with Hardy's more formal narrative, leaving this feeling disjointed and underpowered. Nevertheless, there's still plenty to enjoy in the director's customary flourishes. Read full review&&The relationship between Trishna and Jay never rings as true as it needs to for the downbeat third act to resonate the way it was presumably intended to do. Read full review&&Michael Winterbottom's films aren't always successful, but they're almost always interesting. And, in the case of this odd transplantation from Thomas Hardy's grim Wessex to the glare and blare of contemporary India, spectacular visually, though awfully somber dramatically. Read full review&&The meat of the film is sadly, a tedious misstep for a director who, even when he's experimented in the past, has generally come up with something more interesting than this. It is, however, still better than "9 Songs" Read full review&&There is some very good cinematography in this film and it gives the viewer a real feeling what it is like to live in modern day India. Regarding the story and the acting, I was less enthused. Still I think it's worth one's while.&&This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.&&
