It is almost startlingly beautiful, blessed with deep fiery hues and a poetic sensibility. It is a film made stronger by its belief in itself, and it challenges its audience to believe also.... But because "Daughters" is so gloriously textured, its rewards are many. [20 Mar 1992, p.30]&&Daughters of the Dust is hypnotic, flowing with the trance-like rhythms of a poem that is beautifully written yet deliberately arcane.

The result is a difficult work, yet a haunting one.

If this was a film about a Republican candidate then the critics would have given it horrible ratings. I am in fact a supporter of AOC but if people decide to make films such as this about political candidates can the critics&&Uh Oh - Here Come The Liberals I'm not quite sure who left this brown stain upon the carpet, but this is yet more liberal tripe that pushes an agenda of ideas that are not based upon fact. It seems anyone with an iPhone can now record a video and claim it as a 'documentary'. This video is&&We are really living in a clown world when AOC is getting any significant support. Such unintelligent person as AOC can produce worst results even with best intentions with her biggest attribute which is incompetence.&&

comment: A deeply affecting and intimate tale that rings right through the nerve-ends. Read full review&&I’d hazard to say it’s one of the most original and creative animated features I’ve ever seen: macabre, of course — how could it be otherwise, given the premise? — but remarkably captivating and unexpectedly poetic in the process.

comment: Amy Adams in a performance as deep as it is delightful, is the film's heart and also its flaky, wonderstruck soul. Read full review&&The screenwriter Angus MacLachlan and the director Phil Morrison and an astonishingly perfect cast have quietly made a daring picture. Read full review&&Manages to be one of the genuinely fresh discoveries of the summer, a little gem that deserves to become a big sleeper hit. Read full review&&Not merely a sitcom of cultural clash. Screenwriter Angus Maclachlan has delicately etched a compelling portrait of a way of life whose decencies and simplicities are often dismissed as being "unsophisticated." Read full review&&It's an exhilaratingly decentered tale, with the perspective shifting around so there's no character with whom we totally identify throughout. Read full review&&Combining the tragic and the comic, this drama is amateurish in places, but it's a triumph of atmosphere (the makers are both North Carolinians) and the acting is first-rate. Read full review&&A textbook case of filmmakers who can't make up their minds about their characters; it's a failure of nerve disguised as dramatic ambiguity. Read full review&&This is a great film. In the tradition of Jean Renior and Robert Altman it captures the nuances of life. Sometimes funny, sometimes sad. It is as unpredictable as life.&&Perfect casting. Funny and bittersweet. As an added wonder, the portrait of a genuinely primitive artist.&&Not perfect, but excellent.

Judging from this rancorous drama from writer Angus Maclachlan and director Phil morrison, both North Carolina expatriates, it's either in very short supply or was never there to begin with. Sophisticated, urbane art dealer&&Sinister "Deliverance" meets simpering Melanie Wilkes by way of the lobotomized dysfunction of "The Royal Tennenbaums". A feast of sterotypes and short cuts.
