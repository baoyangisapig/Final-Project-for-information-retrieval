comment: CB4 succeeds on joke overkill, made possible by a story framework that begs for heavy-handed puns and sophomoric sight gags. It is a cotton-candy comedy, far wispier than its prototype, but equally insightful into the rap world as This Is Spinal Tap was to rock. [12 Mar 1993, p.30]&&As with any band movie, this is a moral, rise-and-fall tale. Rock must learn he's a regular guy, not a nasty poseur. Like Spinal Tap, the movie basically peters out, tying up its narrative loose ends. But for the laughs you get, it's a small price to pay. Read full review&&More clever in idea than execution, this mockumentary about a trio of middle-class poseurs masquerading as the World's Most Dangerous Group Not Named N.W.A (Rock even sports Eazy-E's trademark jheri curl) is at its best when it's spoofing the songs of the time — Sweat of My Balls, a hilarious reworking of Kool G.

Never rising above its own crotch-obsessed level of would-be satire, it fails to examine the social issues that give rap music its aggressive vitality, and completely misses every opportunity for intelligent comedy that lies neglected beneath the surface of its imbecilic, gutter-minded excuse for a plot.

comment: Amiable, consistently amusing and surprisingly affecting, it has the flavor of a Nick Hornby novel, with its focus on an overgrown boy struggling to grow up and be a man. Read full review&&David Schwimmer's first bigscreen directing effort reveals something very different: a thoroughly competent mainstream craftsman who imposes no individual character on formulaic material. Read full review&&Run, Fat Boy, Run stays out of sitcom quicksand long enough to make you think that Schwimmer has a knack for this comedy-directing thing. Read full review&&One of the problems with the new comedy Run, Fat Boy, Run is that it’s not English enough, even though its antagonist is a thoroughly detestable American go-getter. Read full review&&The film's bright spot is Irish comedian Dylan Moran, who plays Libby's charmingly dissolute cousin and who also happens to be Dennis' best friend. He's fresh, unpredictable and genuinely funny -- everything the film isn't. Read full review&&Snarkiness and sentiment are in constant battle for supremacy throughout Run, Fat Boy, Run with no chance of a comfortable draw. Read full review&&Simon Pegg has what it takes, but he's saddled himself with a script (co-written by Pegg and Michael Ian Black) that Adam Sandler wouldn't have pulled out of his bottom drawer. Read full review&&Run, fatboy,Run is entertainment. It has a perfect balance of humor, grossout gags and a big heart.What more do you want?It is a film where beneath all the idiocy and goofiness lies a film that has a lesson to it and humor, which most movies don't possess&&Great movie to watch with a girlfriend. It's funny and lighthearted all the way through. Simon Pegg is awesome.&&Saw this movie in england. Very funny! It isn't simon pegg's best but it is very good. Good acting and a okay story. Im not sure if American audiences are ready for the diffrent comedy style. A little slower and drier witt. David schwimmer does americanize it somewhat.&&Not as bad as the "critics" suggest, it is heart warming and funny; what more do you want?&&It was funny, entertaining, the acting was good and the cinematography was pretty good. It was a little bit too predictable and the characters were all pretty cliché, but it was still a fun movie to watch.&&Well it has some funny moments but the story is so ridiculous it's untrue. A few nice cameos here & there but nowhere near as good as Pegg's other work. Dylan Moran plays himself yet again as well.&&A poor movie. Insipid in every way.&&
