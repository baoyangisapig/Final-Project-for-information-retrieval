comment: Foster's daringly different comedy is more interested with observing its well-drawn characters, and what it takes to change them on a fundamental level. It's easy to see it as a drama that fails to fully address America's shortcomings. It's actually something better: an insightful comedy about human perspective. Read full review&&Smart and gripping - at least until the third act. Read full review&&Foster, recovering nicely from her last directorial outing in the surprisingly unfunny "The Beaver," proves her smarts by managing to balance these different strands of humour while keeping the action ticking along. Read full review&&Foster's direction, aided by cinematographer Matthew Libatique's sharp, clean light, is the most fluid and well-considered of her career. The script is an asset, too. Until it becomes a mixed-bag liability. Read full review&&This is no masterpiece, but it’s amiable slice of popcorn entertainment. Read full review&&Unfortunately, as a director, Foster shows no knack or instinct for building tension; her style is strictly presentational, brisk and efficient, but with no sly trickery, desire to surprise or to forge technique that suggests an imaginative approach to storytelling. Read full review&&A stodgy, moribund plodder loaded with stock characters that wouldn’t have felt edgy in 1983 and has about the same contemporary urgency as your average late-night rerun of “CSI: NY.” Read full review&&I really enjoyed this movie. It was suspenseful, enraging, and had the right amount of levity. Julia Roberts and George Clooney were perfect. Jodie Foster did a wonderful job on the whole film&&A tense, fast paced thriller, this was a very engaging, somewhat stressful, experience.

Every minute is tense and keeps your eyes glued to the screen. George Clooney and Julia Roberts both provide great performances and the ending is rather unique. However, this film also tries to say something about Wall Street and the media.&&George Clooney returns for another plain film that intends to solve its own mystery before we can even figure out the case. Money Monster, in this case, is passable.&&The script is terrible, the story is entirely predictable and seen many types before in a slightly different setting. I like Clooney in most movies but he was terrible in this, unfit for the role of Jim Cramer (this is who the movie tried to imitate) as he is too good looking and smooth.&&

comment: A glowing tribute to The Beatles and their music, this is both a toe-tapping pleasure to watch and a smart, occasionally scathing look at how we get things wrong. Read full review&&The film has lots of fun with its premise – until America beckons, then suddenly it seems to lose its head of steam. ... Yet it rallies in style for a beautifully judged and surprisingly moving finale. Read full review&&One thing Yesterday does is rather miraculous. It forces us to hear these Beatles songs as if for the first time. Read full review&&Yesterday isn’t nearly as fantastical, sweet, or light on its feet as it could be—and maybe that’s because of that darn premise. It’s somehow both too basic and too rich. There’s too much one could do with it, but too little vision in what Boyle and Curtis ultimately put forward—even as real tensions, real sticks in music history’s craw, populate the margins. Read full review&&It’s not as if the people never existed, only the band, and the logical conclusion of all this speculation is exactly where the movie takes itself. I don’t want to spoil the party, but it feels like exploitation. Read full review&&Yesterday is a film we’re all familiar with, for better or worse. Read full review&&Yesterday isn’t really about the Beatles. It isn’t about art, or career, or cultural context, or the music business, and it’s only about “love” inasmuch as Hallmark cards and McMansion word art are about love. It isn’t really about anything.

comment: Most segments have a fair share of cheap scares, but they also delve into the art of the build-up, as if delivering a series of grim jokes with bloody punchlines. Consider it a 21st-century take on "Tales from the Crypt." Read full review&&Like last year's "Chronicle," here's another reminder that in the right hands found footage still has plenty of capacity to surprise. Read full review&&Scrappy and unsettling, V/H/S puts the majority of today's mainstream "scary" movies to shame. Read full review&&The problem with V/H/S, a compilation of sometimes scary horror shorts loosely bound by an overarching plot, is that, no matter how savage, evil or sadistic the killer, the victims almost always come off as bigger jerks.&&V/H/S comes across as a production that wants to be more than it is but, as they say, The Emperor has no clothes. Read full review&&I'm not sure V/H/S is brilliant cinema or anything – indeed, I'm not sure it's appropriate to call it cinema at all – but it sure is an ingenious hybrid: part Godardian art film, part abstract video experiment, part sleazy shocker, and all self-castigating interrogation of what film-theory types call the "male gaze."

It is not perfect but its imperfections barely make this movie unwatchable. It has fun scares, creepiness, and gross-out disturbing imagery. It is only entertaining and a must watch for horror fans.&&This movie has all the right creep-factor going on, while avoiding slipping into torture porn territory.

Enjoyable fun. Creepy, funny but ultimately uneven. One-time watch.&&This is a movie that is extremely different than other horror movies, it is chilling and scary, at the same time it gets funny but ridiculous, the story is unexplained a lot, it is just a group of people, who broke into an abandoned house to steal a V/H/S tape, but they find collection of&&OK, part 1 of the V/H/S franshise is not the best, but also not the worst.
