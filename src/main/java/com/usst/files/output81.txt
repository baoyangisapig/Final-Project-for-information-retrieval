Read full review&&Jon Amiel, who previously directed "Sommersby," delivers a taut, gripping thriller and, with the help of his accomplished leads, succeeds in camouflaging some of the mammoth holes in Ann Biderman and David Madsen's otherwise intelligent and inventive screenplay. Read full review&&By having Sigourney Weaver and Holly Hunter play the maniacs' feisty antagonists, the filmmakers seem to believe that they've made a significant feminist statement, the movie's two hours-plus of almost continual sadistic abuse of women notwithstanding. Even in an industry known for self-delusion, that is quite a feat. Read full review&&The acting is capable and the suspense is effective at times, but the gore is grisly and the climax is surprisingly hokey. Read full review&&Holly Hunter and Sigourney Weaver, a cop and a shrink, are the main trackers, but so little is done in Ann Biderman and David Madsen's script to give them or their colleagues or even their prey interesting human dimensions that the overall ambience is chiefly pornographic.

comment: The plot is a little of Fatal Attraction, a little of Jagged Edge and a little of Wall Street. It works because it's so audacious in combining elements that don't seem to belong together. Read full review&&It's a likable action picture that's fun and entertaining even when it's a bit silly. [16 Mar 1990, p.E1]&&Short on plausibility but preserving the psycho-sexual ambiguities throughout, Bigelow's seductively stylish, wildy fetishistic thriller is proof that a woman can enter a traditionally male world and, like Megan, beat men at their own game. Read full review&&Neither the actress nor her director disgrace themselves, and Curtis does suggest a commitment to her character that goes above and beyond the limitations of the script, but they've both done more interesting work. [16 Mar 1990, p.26]&&What starts out as a moody arthouse flick rapidly becomes an uneven B-movie yukfest (sometimes intentional, sometimes not), with low-budget concessions to the Hollywood cop-versus-killer industry. Read full review&&The slightly androgynous Curtis is always interesting to watch; her sentience, her thin lips pressed into an ironic smile, her hood-ornament sleekness are tempered by a believable capacity for edgy affection. But the fact that the force is against her is minor compared to the way the film is against her. Blue Steel victimizes her more than any of the celluloid heavies in it. [16 Mar 1990, p.42]&&Blue Steel is unpleasant and wearily predictable, a near-unbearable 103 minutes even for fanciers of urban cop films. Its one distinction, lead Jamie Lee Curtis aside, is its backhanded bone-toss to feminists: Now we know that women, too, can direct serial-killer crumminess. [16 Mar 1990, p.4D]&&

summary: It was supposed to be the vacation of a lifetime in the Australian Outback -- full of fun, sun and adventure. But what happened to a trio of twenty-something backpackers took a wrenching detour into the depths of unrelenting terror.

comment: Every single performance is the result of a cast that has gone to the far reaches of acting ability and even exceeded them. Read full review&&Essentially a worst-case-scenario white-knuckler executed with terrifically focused skill and realism. Read full review&&Director McLean doesn't let up on the suspense, which builds to an electrifying climax that is greatly abetted by Will Gibson's gritty cinematography and Francois Tetaz' nerves-inducing score. Read full review&&As horror movies go, this is a pretty good one. Read full review&&John Jarratt is perfectly creepy as the outback loner gone psychotic survivalist who gets his kicks from the systematic degradation and torture of hapless victims. And make no mistake, the ordeal is excruciating. Read full review&&The ambitions are so paltry that our response should be too: Wolf Creek is unimaginative, light on the grue and heavy on the faux-serious desperation. Read full review&&There is a line and this movie crosses it. I don't know where the line is, but it's way north of Wolf Creek. There is a role for violence in film, but what the hell is the purpose of this sadistic celebration of pain and cruelty? Read full review&&Ignore the reviews that don't give this 8 and above. These people are idiots. They complain that the movie is sick and depraved. It's meant to be, did you walk into the cinema expecting bloody THE HAPPIEST LITTLE ELF.

Not to be confused with your cheesy (and in many ways more disgusting) kill-for-a-laugh flicks, this looks at the darker side of human nature in an uncompromising fashion.&&This movie was not enjoyable and & left me with some pretty twisted images to shake off after leaving the cinema. However that is precisely the movie's strength. It is baffling to me why when at last a movie is released that is *actually* scary, critics cry murder. The main criticisms&&Not as good as I was expecting from Sundance buzz, but still a merciless thriller.&&Pretty scary movie that starts slowly and then turns torturous after a long while. I do not want to go to Australia after seeing this movie.&&The only part of horror in this movie is the word horrible... DO NOT RECOMMEND.&&I regret going to see this movie. It was so boring, and took a long time before the action started. It's not even scary. Wolf Creek is nothing compared to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Save your money and don't go and see it.&&

comment: Nods to "Hostel" and "Glengarry Glen Ross" make for a cine-literate affair further buffered by a smart cameo from erstwhile Brat Packer Andrew McCarthy. Read full review&&Deadpan and a bit dopey, Brooklyn Brothers Beat the Best has a shaggy charm, and the chemistry between the tuneful twosome's would-be Sal Paradise and Dean Moriarty makes up for the inevitable rock-and-roll road movie cliches. Read full review&&Although the sentiment threatens to flatten out an intriguingly nervy vibe, Brooklyn Brothers Beat the Best has plenty of rhythmic charm about its responsibility-challenged strivers. Read full review&&The comedy is at odds, perhaps even at war, with the gravitational downward pull of bittersweet seriousness, and the sucrose content is pretty high by the end. But it's an entertaining film. Read full review&&This ode to indie legitimacy proves to be too cartoonish to feel real and not outrageous enough to be memorable. Read full review&&O'Nan and Weston's rapport is engagingly prickly but their "Shins meets Sesame Street" tunes have a tweeness also found in the director's music montages and lens flares.
