Read full review&&Looks drab and doesn't take very good advantage of its New York locations, but the neurotic intensity and emotional honesty of its two leads more than make up for it. Read full review&&"Happy Accidents" should retire Tomei's status as part of a show-biz urban legend and establish her once and for all as one of our most versatile and engaging performers.&&Gleefully silly fun, with a few core concepts on the nature of time, space, and la-la-la-love thrown in for good measure. And who can resist a puffin, anyway? Read full review&&The leads smooth over the plot holes endemic to all 4D fables, making the movie more than mere déjà vu. Read full review&&D'Onofrio is a natural for the role of a romantic who just may be a freak. A highly physical actor, he ranges between sweetly awkward and a candidate for the kind of mental hospital shown in "Session 9."&&It's a warped kind of romantic comedy in which the whole is substantially less than the sum of the parts.&&I enjoyed the middle of the movie the most dreading the moment when something would ruin it for me and I'd end up hating the movie, but that never happened. for now, this is my favorite movie, i cant get sick of watching this. don't expect sex, drugs or violence. just cuteness.&&This is a quirky romantic movie and little far fetched but adorable. It was refreshing to see a movie that makes you laugh and your heart pitter-patter at the same time. Simply marvelous!&&Unexpected and beautiful. It plays like a mobius strip but without all the usual **** that comes with a time based plot. Glad I came across this and would highly recommend it. It's unique and genuine. well-acted and without pretense. similar in feel to about time, which is another suberp&&A slow burner of a movie which at some points the flame is all but extinguished.The story certainly opens avenues which could have, should be been more visually enhanced along with the pace and character relations. I so wanted to watch this after waiting 15 years to see it and compose&&

comment: Herman handled his script cleanly and cast the picture well. [09Jun1997 Pg 30]&&The pitch of the script, written by director Mark Herman, isn't perfect. But these earthy blokes are an engaging lot, the soot of the earth, with an admirably wry view of their bleak situations. [23May1997 Pg 03.D]&&Brassed Off! is a traditional feel-good motion picture with an element of social commentary thrown in for good measure. Read full review&&There's a double meaning in the title of this folksy, relentlessly political, heavy-handed story, written and directed by Mark Herman and set among the coal mines of Yorkshire, England, in 1992. Read full review&&However, writer-director Mark Herman never really achieves the correct balance between the serious and the feelgood, allowing an uneasy tone to prevail, while the small screen style and supporting cast of familiar TV faces suggests this would play more comfortably on the box. Read full review&&Herman isn't sure if he's doing a big-statement picture or a tiny treasure of a comedy, and his confusion throws Brassed Off off balance. Read full review&&Trimmed to an hour, and tucked between a documentary on snails and an episode of Coronation Street, writer-director Mark Herman's Brassed Off could prove lively watching indeed. As it is, however, his pedestrian if sweetly well-meaning inspirational about a coal-mining town done in by Thatcherism is too long, too laborious and 15 years too late. Read full review&&
