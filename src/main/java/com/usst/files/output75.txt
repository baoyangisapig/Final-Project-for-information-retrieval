comment: The director, Tobe Hooper, who honed his scary craft on such films as ''The Texas Chain Saw Massacre'' and ''Poltergeist,'' knows how to construct a horror film so it builds to a screaming pitch. He shoots many of his images from below, to give the view a child might have, and deftly manipulates the audience to feel the growing menace. He is helped by an excellent cast.

She also turns in the best performance as the school marm who, after the Martians get to her, gobbles a bullfrog and becomes the movie's gleeful and insane Madame LaFarge. [14 June 1986, p.C6]&&Despite its occasional sparkle, Invaders From Mars is an overlong movie with a tiny spirit. It plays to a certain smug superiority of an audience nurtured on junky television, and while that smugness is in some ways justified -- movies like the original "Invaders From Mars" had their obvious failings -- it's also, over the course of a feature film, more than a little annoying.

Read full review&&More a middle-of-the-road rom-com than a teen-spirit sendup, the pic weaves its lighthearted mix of silly and serious with increasingly heavy-handed spiels on self-esteem. Read full review&&This is a heartfelt and charismatic teen movie that gives a platform to a promising young talent. Read full review&&If you've seen "Mean Girls" or "Easy A," you've seen a far better version of The DUFF. Read full review&&Between its grating heroine, strident speechifying, derivative plot and draggy tone and tempo, it’s like the redheaded stepchild of “Mean Girls” and “Freaky Friday.” Read full review&&This movie was outstanding. It teaches young adults to not try to change who they are and be themselves.Sadly, I didn't see the turnout i was hoping for of the amount of people but it was a very good Movie. 10/10&&Great movie with a powerful message. For a dramedy, it wasn't that funny, just entertaining. Also amazing performances by pretty much everybody. I wish they keep on making movies like this aimed toward teens.&&The DUFF is something clearly not made for people like me. I am looking for comedy without borders, but DUFF keeps it in the borders, when I look for acting, I find Bella Thorne, which is really not amusing. But, it was fresh, original and admittedly, funny. This is a film that climbes up&&The Duff chick flick movie, is something that teenagers can relate, and some just eh not so so much. I am a dude so i can not relate to this **** and "the popular girl," Bella Thorne her acting skills is not that well done she has no place to be in Hollywood. There is some mean spirited&&The Duff is a strong teen movie, that was kind of unexpected. Mae Whitman has a great performance in this film which is unexpected for her first major leading role. We end up cheering for her throughout the film like an underdog sports team. She's not necessarily that funny all the time but&&Was surprised by this one. A meaty performance from Mae Whitman pushes this past regular teen fodder into a fresh comedic space, even if the ending is predictable.&&The whole movie is cliche and it didn't even work like a teen comedy - there are good ones and this is far away from good. It wasn't funny, but not serious too. The main character was somehow charming, but the movie was still dumb.&&
