Read full review&&It is also extremely well acted at every level (one especially wants to single out Bob Balaban as the Government's chief aggressor and Wilford Brimley as its belated voice of conscience), and directed by Sidney Pollack with a sort of crisp but unassuming professionalism that is rarer than it ought to be. Perhaps best of all, the script, by sometime Journalist Kurt Luedtke, who was once part of a Pulitzer-winning investigative team on the Detroit Free Press, has a marvelously entertaining intricacy, briskly and believably building, half-inch by half-inch, Michael's outrage over and Megan's entrapment in the plot to get him.

Still, excessively generous allowance must be made if one is to overlook the defects and confuse Absence of Malice with a pertinent, lucid melodrama on a hot topic.

Read full review&&While Westwood is certainly a remarkable personal and cultural figure in many senses, it’s too bad she’s not more willing to discuss the genesis of punk, since it’s likely to remain the primary thing she’s known for. Read full review&&There are many words that you can use to describe Ms. Westwood (born 1941), an early punk rock tastemaker and merchandizer turned global couture brand. Boring certainly is not one of them. And as the movie jumps from past to present, from street to palace, from the Sex Pistols to Queen Elizabeth II, Ms. Westwood’s claim sounds increasingly strange and borderline ridiculous. Read full review&&While I learned a lot about Westwood, it just didn’t feel like enough. Read full review&&It’s an amusing gloss on a punk icon who never gave up the rebellion and never let go of the safety pins. Read full review&&The film is over quickly, before I’d seen quite enough of Westwood’s fanciful clothing, or heard quite enough of her voice. Read full review&&The fact that you can sense Westwood’s disillusionment with the documentary project while watching it creates some interesting tension, but director Lorna Tucker doesn’t fully exploit it or turn it into meta commentary.

comment: It's a terrific movie, smart and funny enough to hold up at any time of year. Read full review&&How many human beings among us are capable of making a comedy with wit and intelligence that also takes bold pleasure in unabashed silliness? I think this is what happens when you let an elf loose with a movie camera. Read full review&&Pays homage to a sack of Christmas movies, from the department store Claus of "Miracle on 34th Street" to a standing-on-the-bridge-contemplating-suicide moment, a la "It's a Wonderful Life." Read full review&&If you’re not a fan of Will Ferrell, you ain't gonna like this film. But if you think he's funny and you don't mind a sappy ending, this is a decent holiday flick. Read full review&&A charming, silly family Christmas movie more likely to spread real joy than migraine, indigestion and sugar shock. The movie succeeds because it at once restrains its sticky, gooey good cheer and wildly overdoes it. Read full review&&Elf is jolly but could have been jollier, funny but could have been funnier, charming but ... well, point made. Read full review&&The first and possibly the last Will Ferrell star vehicle. It's a clumsy, tedious ride that wears out its welcome as it wears out the seat of your pants and the circulation in your lower limbs. Read full review&&GREAT FILM! it was funny and a perfect christmas movie to watch some parts of the movie are just too funny. Will Ferrell plays the part of elf really well.&&I love Elf. It is definitely one of my favorite Christmas movies. The jokes are hilarious!!! Will Ferrell plays Buddy the Elf so well. This movie is also a great family movie. I also get a lot of nostalgia from watching this movie.

Total: 9.75 (rounding it to 10)&&One of the best Christmas movie ever. Home Alone, The Grinch, Charlie Brown, and this are the best movies for Christmas. The story and jokes are amazing and are even good if you watch it multiple times.&&Elf is jam packed with Christmas spirit, making it an instant must watch for the holiday season. It's also heart-warming, hilarious, quotable and (thanks to Will Ferrell) lovable.&&Great film. Timing is perfect. Falls short of being heart felt but still enjoyable for any age. A must see film.&&Very enjoyable, funny at alot of moments. But the ending falls apart.&&This movie was absolutely painful to watch. The humour is very childish - fart jokes are NOT funny. After cringing for the entire start of the movie, I ended up walking out because it was so bad.&&
