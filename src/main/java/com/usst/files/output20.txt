comment: With House Party, the Hudlins have made a happy, harmless romp of a movie that, in its own minor way, manages to make a contribution to black cinema. There is a measure of social equality in the mere fact that black teens get stupid movies made about them, too. [9 Mar 1990, p.E6]&&Catchy and unobtrusively assured, it's both hip and innocent, stylized and natural, charming its way through a conventional hey-kids-let's-have-a-party plot with bright comedy, great dancing, and on-top-of-it rap.

[23 Mar 1990, p.43]&&House Party captures contemporary black teen culture in a way that’s fresh, commercial and very catchy. Read full review&&Because of its patently commercial instincts, this is basically a black knock-off of a popular genre. Yet, despite those instincts, and despite the sophomoric moralizing, the movie has zest. The edges are sharp; it holds our attention by holding on to the vestiges of its unique black perspective. In that sense, House Party doesn't so much sell out as buy in - there are worse faults. [11 May 1990]&&Most of the time the film slides along on funky music, lively dance and snappy street-style dialogue. Other teen comedies feature more hair-raising plots and spectacular stunts; other teen comedies are far more sexually explicit. House Party has a wistful, almost naive, air that runs counter to the broad-based perception of young blacks as hardened and hopeless, one step away from doing hard time. [9 Mar 1990, p.6]&&Not only is House Party breezy fun, but its dialogue often sounds as authentic to its black-teen setting as The Breakfast Club did to its white-teen one.

comment: This is a classic film, not just because every scene and line is casually beautiful and devoid of extraneous touches, but because its tone is mercilessly exact. Read full review&&A fantastic, sleek and fun satire. Read full review&&If you see him (Jake Gyllenhaal)onscreen in Nightcrawler, you’ll have a closeup view of one of the movie year’s most compelling sociopaths. He’s something you can’t turn away from. Read full review&&From a subdued start Nightcrawler unfurls into a ghoulish and wickedly funny satire on journalism, the job market and self-help culture. Read full review&&The film has a sulfuric, Dostoyevskian quality — and sick sense of humor — that captures the muted aquarium that Los Angeles becomes at night, a spell that’s broken once plot overtakes mood. Read full review&&Rene Russo is spot-on as Nina, an aging TV news director who is the only person Bloom will sell his footage to. Read full review&&After a few minutes you know everything about Louis you’re going to know; the only surprise in Nightcrawler is the level of grotesqueness it achieves. There’s more insight (and entertainment) in an average sketch from the old SCTV series; I kept imagining Joe Flaherty’s horror host Count Floyd climbing out of his coffin and chanting, “Oooh, that Louis, he’s veh-ry skerrrr-y, kiddies — ahwoooooooo!” Read full review&&THE best film I've seen in years. Honest in its abrasive satire. Can you believe we mythologize CEOs? They are some of the sickest mofos ever. Jake's performance is the best he's done. He's never looked uglier, physically or as a character, but he's never been more charismatic, either.&&Nightcrawler is a modern achievement.Jake Gyllenhaal plays a sociopath bent on success, and he won't let anything or anyone stand in his way. Gyllenhaal is really hitting his stride this year, complete with this movie, Enemy, and Prisoners. I personally think this is his best role yet.&&This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.&&Lou Bloom: "Steady hands, steady hands".The story is about a young man, desperate for work, stumbles upon the seedy underworld of L.A.'s crime journalism. The break-neck pace is all about being the first on the scene - murder, accidents, fires, mayhem - and selling the gratuitous footage&&Jake Gyllenhaal is incredible in this adventure of a criminal cinematographer who is capable of doing anything to achieve his goals and be successful.

Jake Gyllenhall plays a sociopathic denizen of Los Angeles eking out an existence by stealing and pawning scrap materials.
