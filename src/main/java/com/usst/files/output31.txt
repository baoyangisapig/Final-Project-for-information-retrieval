comment: Fed Up is a glossy package that gets its warnings across loud and clear: we need to change what we eat. Read full review&&A surprisingly in-depth and confrontational examination into the obesity epidemic among Americans, especially children, over the last 30 years. Read full review&&A whirlwind of talking heads, found footage, scary statistics and cartoonish graphics, the movie is a fast, coolly incensed investigation into why people are getting fatter. Read full review&&Like “An Inconvenient Truth” (2006), the Oscar-winning film about climate change, it is a call to action. As a screed, it builds a credible, engaging argument, presenting evidence, statistics, talking-head testimony, whimsical charts, poignant personal stories, and animated illustrations of digestive processes to make its case. Read full review&&And that's Fed Up's ultimate, if not fatal, weakness: The movie seems to acquit consumers of any culpability in our health crisis. Read full review&&Along with producer Laurie David (who was also behind Inconvenient Truth) and director Stephanie Soechtig, Couric has made an unabashed muckraking documentary that ends with a call to action that’s half inspirational, half grating. It’s propaganda, to be sure, but effective propaganda. Read full review&&Despite the film’s worthy goals, there are some empty calories. Katie Couric’s narration and Soechtig’s uninspired style make it feel more like a TV special than a feature documentary. Read full review&&This movie needs to be seen by everyone. It is very human. And it provides useful science. And it recounts some politics that need to be shown the light of day. And no I do not work for the film makers. I am a former PE teacher who wishes I could show this to my classes. But I will make sure&&Fantastic Fantastic Fantastic. I thought i knew alot about sugar but this movie opened my eyes to the whole 'sugar is the new tobacco'. The movie should be watched by all.&&A great overview on the basics. Those interested in delving deeper into the history and research should access the many lectures given by Taubes and Lustig for free on Youtube. If you've already studied this issue you'll probably find Fed Up to be a bit basic, however it's still&&The largest health issue in the world today is obesity, primarily due to sugar and the big business that shamelessly sells it. As a film, this is standard doc fare: lots of expert interviews, snappy graphics, media footage (much of it horribly grainy) and real people whose stories make it&&This was a good, if somewhat sad documentary - it was tough to see those kids struggling to lose weight, really wanting to but not being able to for some reason. The documentary takes aim at the American sugar and processed food corporations and blames them for our obesity epidemic - but it&&it all boils down to common sense, still the movie had pretty visuals, and was informative, but it became ironic that most of what you see is junk food advertising.&&Journalists that can't be bothered to stay up-to-date on scientific publications and instead hyper-focus on their pet subject of bureaucracy and corporations which make deals to deceive the citizenry which can't be bothered to stay up-to-date on scientific publications and instead&&

comment: For all its portentousness, this is the best Harry Potter picture yet. In some ways, it improves on J.K. Rowling’s novel, which is punishingly protracted and builds to a climactic wand-off better seen than read. Read full review&&It will hook you good and keep you riveted. Read full review&&The whole film is about innocence and experience, and if it isn't a Blakean song, it is a sturdy and vibrant piece of prose. Read full review&&Is there an admired British thespian who hasn't toiled in Potter's field? Read full review&&A sleek, swift and exciting adaptation of J. K. Rowling’s longest novel to date. Read full review&&Whatever happened to the delight and, if you'll excuse the term, the magic in the "Harry Potter" series? As the characters grow up, the stories grow, too, leaving the innocence behind and confusing us with plots so labyrinthine that it takes a Ph.D from Hogwarts to figure them out. Read full review&&Less magic also means less fun and discovery, as Harry battles depression and a hostile press; this is the bleakest Potter installment to date, and under David Yates's choppy direction, Maggie Smith, Emma Thompson, Brendan Gleeson, and David Thewlis have little more than walk-ons. Read full review&&My personal favorite of the movies, the one I believe is most faithful to the books (while taking into consideration the changes made in the previous movies as well). The final battle between Voldemort and Dumbledore is one of my favorite moments fom the whole Harry Potter franchise.&&Awesome movie, it really captures the essence of the film.&&While it was a bit too fast paced, I think the filmmakers did an awesome job of taking a 900 page book and turning it in a tight, psychological thriller. The acting was top notch, especially from Imelda Staunton and Daniel Radcliffe, who gives a powerful, emotional performance. This is a&&Fun film, Yates took some steps away from Curon and Columbus- but overall a nice dark tale with excellent shots.&&Worst so far but still decent, characters are starting to get annoying but otherwise its okay.&&Not good. Not bad. Suprisingly mundane. Save your time and read the books...&&A Grave disappointment to Harry Potter fans everywhere.&&
