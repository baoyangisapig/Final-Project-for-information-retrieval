comment: Franco gives one of his most subtle performances yet as a recovering-alcoholic father, and the three young newcomers’ performances are honest and affecting, capturing what it feels like to be adrift and on the verge of adolescence. Read full review&&Yosemite is a contemplative drama, low-key perhaps to a fault. But Demeestere shows acute sensitivity in her understanding of boys and their growing awareness of the world, with its real and imagined menaces. Read full review&&Resolutely unshowy, sometimes almost too lower-case in its observations, Yosemite pays off in an authenticity that pervades both individual scene rhythms and performances. Read full review&&Like Gia Coppola's Palo Alto (2013), a lyric and biting evocation of contemporary well-to-do teendom, Gabrielle Demeestere's Yosemite mines Franco's fiction for its most vital quality: his unsentimental depiction of youthful insecurity, this time among fifth-graders.&&Ms. Demeestere’s direction winds up frustratingly splitting the difference between thoughtfully detached and just plain vague. Read full review&&Although evocative and nicely observed, the coming-of-age drama Yosemite ultimately proves too low-key and elliptical to make much of an impression. Read full review&&It never adds up to anything more than the mood Demeestere manages to translate from Franco’s fiction. Which makes Yosemite a “film festival movie,” nothing more than a promising idea or two and an interesting tone to recommend it. Read full review&&

comment: With nifty new villains, a revived Green Goblin, plus $300 million worth of aerial special effects, Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 3 is definitely good to go. Read full review&&The good news about Spider-Man 3 is that it's more of the same -- except better. Read full review&&There are delicious bits aplenty in Spider-Man 3 for those who care to notice. Read full review&&This incarnation of Spider Man seems to forget that its source material was a comic book that wanted to transcend its genre. This is a movie that's content to be pretty good within its genre, with the main distinction of being much bigger than any of its competition. Read full review&&Still smart, still exciting and still action-packed. It's just a shame to note that, after promising greatness, all Spider-Man 3 delivers is satisfaction. Read full review&&Though aspects of it are entertaining, the presence of all these mismatched pieces give Spider-Man 3 an ungainly, cumbersome feeling, as if its plot elements were the product of competing contractors who never saw the need to cooperate on a coherent final product. Read full review&&"Spider-Man 2" was a textbook example of how to make a sequel: Deepen it, make it funnier, give it more heart and come up with a strong villain and a good story.

I've heard complaints about Venom, too many villains, etc. Well, whatever! I don't care for any of that!

It ENHANCES emotions/powers, so when he is in the black suit, ALL of his emotions are enhanced...&&SM3 IMO is a solid final movie in the Raimi trilogy of films. Some standout fantasticly choreographed action sequences that manage to tell story at the same time are supremely well handled here. The quality and details (esp in 4k) are a noticeable improvement in SM3 over the visual effects&&Oh what a shame to waste such a great opportunity, such a stellar cast and such potential on an incredibly underwhelming film like this. This movie had so much going for it, the first two installments were home runs, amazing films, they had everything to make a great ending to Raimi's&&Spidey 3 provides mesmerizing special effects; however, that is its only saving grace. Audiences will be inundated with an esoteric and complicated storyline, partly because of the addition of three new villains, which are not sufficiently delved into and which thereby dilutes their&&Definitely the weakest of the three (what is it with Marvel #3's? X-Men 3 reaked as well). The audience I was with seemed bored throughout and laughed only once. And that was the Jonah Jameson pill scene. Not a good sign.

comment: It may lack subtlety, but everything is beautifully designed and photographed, Watling and Tosar are superb and it's undeniably great fun. Read full review&&Unconscious is a ribald sex farce of considerable imagination and inspired wackiness and a meticulous period piece of the Art Nouveau era. Read full review&&If Unconscious consistently overplays its hand, its fusion of a Sherlock Holmes-style detective story (Alma is the master sleuth, and Salvador her Dr. Watson) with a delirious bedroom farce in the spirit of early Pedro Almodóvar is frequently very funny. Read full review&&The movie's message is clear: Freud's greatest contribution to society was not the idea that all little boys long to sleep with their mothers--rather, it's the concept of the unconscious, a hidden place where our secret desires yearn to be free. Read full review&&A brilliant exploration into the implications of Freud’s theories on one family. Read full review&&While the content is colorful and the actors seem up for the task, a flawed script and Oristrell's unemphatic direction let all the impact dribble away.
