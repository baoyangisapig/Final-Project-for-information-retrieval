It is a great story about reconnecting families and relationships as we age. It is a must see this holiday season. Yeah to all involved!&&This move is great! One of the best family movies I have seen in awhile. I live in the midwest and that movie portrays the average father almost perfectly. The father figure is alway's the one that is tough on the family while everyone runs to the mom when they need to tell their&&I've seen this film twice in two days with different people. Interestingly enough, I thought it would be a fun film dealing with the dynamics of the family. From start to end I was emotionally drawn in and never let go. This is a film that stays with you long after you finish watching.&&I certainly did not see this movie as anything like "cheap sentimentality". In fact. other than A Serious Man, I dont know of a better 2009 release. I guess one has to be both an old man ans a Dad to really appreciate it.&&This movie was the biggest tear jerker I've experienced in quite sometime, bawling out loud in the theatre proves true artistry and connection to an audience. De Niro delivers an incredible performance once again- the story line does begin to get predictable but still a wonderful film.&&The journey got a bit predictable, but the acting was great. Though the relationship with Deniro and David was emphasized a bit much, the final message that human beings were fine being their imperfect selves was one this society needs to hear more of. I was touched.&&The DeNiro who curses, that's the DeNiro we're most familiar with; the DeNiro of the seventies and eighties, the DeNiro of verve and purpose. What ever happened to that guy? As a widower named Frank Goode, this iconic portrayer of miscreants and misfits may have his best part&&

comment: The Miyazaki legacy is in good hands. Read full review&&An odd little film that aims only to please itself. Read full review&&The sights and sounds are splendid--a lovingly hand-detailed portside city, a touching musical interlude in a windswept field--though they're largely disconnected from the narrative proper. Read full review&&This film is too scary for very young children, while older fans are likely to focus on the film not faring well in comparison to the elder Miyazaki's recent work.

I think Hayao's son has a great future ahead in animation.&&Taken on its own merits the film is outstanding. People seem dissapointed that he is not his father, this is ridiculous. But like his father's work, the more I viewed the film, the better I liked it. I look forward to his future. Timothy Dalton is solid, and Willem Defoe is at his creepy&&If you're looking for a work along the lines of Spirited Away and are expecting this to be a Hayao film, then Don't think of this movie as such. It is exciting and interesting and stunning to look at. Its not a faithful adaptation nor is it a Hayao M. Masterpiece. But it is great on its own&&its not the kind of Hayao Miyazaki, but its very entertaining and it inspires us from the book by Ursula K. LeGuin. the animation was beautiful, the characters were perfect, and the cinematography was great. Tales from Earthsea is so great and kids and adults will enjoy it.&&I didn't read the original book, yet. However it's a well meaning story about a declining realm and the dysfunctional, troubled characters, and their efforts for save it from disgrace. The first effort of Goro Miyazaki for following the footsteps of his father is notorious but a little far&&"Tales from Earthsea" is once again, wonderfully animated by Ghibli, and despite its usage of violence and finess lacking and its confusing plot elements, its rather not that bad. While it's not as warming other Ghibli movies, it still conveys enough action that it's not considered bad.&&Wow - definitely not in the same league as his father. It's a little sad that Ursula Guin gave permission thinking H Miyazaki would direct and then it was handed to his son. Really pretty disloyal to the books - Better if you had never read them as the movie essentially contains the names&&

comment: Too many scenes in European Vacation peter out about a gag or two short for the film to be as funny as it ought to be. But the basic amiability of the humor is as pleasant as it is surprising. Read full review&&The London scenes are enjoyable – the ‘look kids... Big Ben... Parliament’ roundabout routine should be a staple of every family trip to the capital – but overall, it’s not quite funny or memorable enough. Read full review&&While it's very much a retread, it succeeds in following up the first film's humor with more in a similar vein. Read full review&&National Lampoon's European Vacation is directed by Amy Heckerling, whose career began with the spunky if not inventive Fast Times at Ridgemont High and continued with the inventive if not spunky Johnny Dangerously; this time, she's responsible for a picture that's neither inventive nor spunky. [29 July 1985]&&Chase and D'Angelo are clever and naturally funny, and they're well-matched. And yet the movie is dumb, so dumb it must have taken some work to make it that way. Perhaps next the Griswalds should make a forced march through a Hollywood executive's brain. [27 July 1985, p.B3]&&Director Amy Heckerling cripples half her jokes by telegraphing the punch lines: a sight gag at the top of the Eiffel Tower involving a tossed hat and a little dog would be a lot funnier if we hadn't seen it coming. Some of the jokes seem 25 years out of date: one hardly has to go all the way to France these days, much less cross a state line, to encounter a racy topless bar. [12 Aug 1985, p.71]&&Heckerling directs this mess with no sense of pace and less sense of where to put the camera. There are pixilated, MTV-style sequences that simply slow up the story, car chases and car crashes, and, of course, aerobicizers boinging out of their leotards. The best thing in the movie is the catchy theme from the last Vacation, which, unfortunately, hasn't the slightest thing to do with Europe. Read full review&&

comment: The dread becomes so palpable that the implausibility of a wooden door with three tiny locks somehow containing the Devil actually proves itself scarier as a result. Read full review&&Clever-but-frustrating. Read full review&&Silly and scary, atmospheric and disjointed, I Trapped the Devil showcases Lobo’s affection for the genre. He wisely avoids falling into the “gore” trap, instead relying on characterization and our fear of the unknown to raise the hair on the back of your neck. Read full review&&Lobo overdoes the sudden shifts between the real and the surreal in the last act, refusing to answer any questions definitively until he has to. But the first-time filmmaker shows an impressive amount of confidence in his methods. He knows how to make audiences uncomfortable — first with tedium, then with terror. Read full review&&Doesn’t ultimately provide quite enough reward for a slow buildup. But it proves Lobo an able helmer (if one who could probably use a co-writer next time), eking decent atmospherics and good performances within a potentially claustrophobic premise. Read full review&&By seesawing between bland normalcy and hellishness, Lobo denies his audience the immersive horror that his film’s best images promise. Read full review&&Unfortunately, for all the debuting filmmaker's talent for creepy atmospherics, I Trapped the Devil feels draggy and attenuated even with its brief 82-minute running time including credits. Despite some good performances, the film goes nowhere, and very, very slowly. Read full review&&
