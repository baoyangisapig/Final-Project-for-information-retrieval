comment: A modest and charmingly genuine youth movie. Mischief doesn't, to be sure, fall squarely into the latter, uncrowded category that includes Diner, The Flamingo Kid, and Puberty Blues. But it has a lot more going for it than Porky's.[9 Feb 1985]&&Mischief is captivating enough that its small failings are forgiveable. Its four principal actors -- McKeon, Stewart, Preston and Nash -- are fine-looking, but they don't rely on that surface characteristic to get them through. Under Mel Damski's direction, they seem to know their craft. And so, Mischief is a twinkle for the eye and a wash of nostalgia for the memory. [11 Feb 1985, p.D4]&&As comfortable as an old pair of saddle shoes, and just as worn...But for the persistent nostalgia buff, there are rewards -- five cents on a cash register, a dollar's worth of gas, car hops, submarine races, Howdy Doody, mirror dice, stacks of 45s -- all the froth that's left at the end of the ice cream soda.

You the viewer may choose this movie even if you aren’t a Pokéscholar. That doesn’t mean it’s willing to choose you.
