comment: The beauty of Swingers lies in the irony of its title: Despite their lounge-lizard posing, these guys will never really live up to their Rat Pack dreams.&&Confident of its emotional effects, Swingers knows how to breathe life into its people, and hooking audiences is its reward. Read full review&&Engaging, refreshingly human in its humor and becomingly modest in its aspirations, this hip look at being out of it announces some promising new talent and will play well with young audiences looking for comfortable entertainment that doesn't feel manufactured. Read full review&&It's a "First Wives Club" for single guys, giving voice to a whole range of authentic, if not always responsible, attitudes and emotions. Read full review&&Uneven, amateurish and borderline misogynistic. But it's also very funny, and it never loses its cool. Read full review&&Movies about the trajectory from outsider to insider in LA social and professional circles--the two always seem inextricably linked--are a dime a dozen, but this one is fresh, thanks to a script by lead actor Jon Favreau that lets us know Mike knows he resembles a character in a movie even if he doesn't know he is one. Read full review&&This is a pretty leaden cinematic experience.&&This is one of the funniest movies ever made. I recommend this to everyone because the movie is all that it tries to be and so much more. Very funny!&&Swingers is almost a perfect film. From the opening trip to Vegas to the final frame it achieves what it sets out to do which is tell a story of failing actors who are so naive they think they have what it takes to make it big. The main story is that of Jon Favreau's Mike, a heartbroken&&Great timing from both leads. Very quotable. Funny!&&This is the first place I can remember seeing Vince Vaughn and since this is the only role I see him playing. Great interplay between stereotypical stud/loser friend.

comment: Wonderstruck embraces so many shimmery, evanescent ideas, it’s a marvel that any one picture—let alone one you can take your kids to—can hold them. Read full review&&There is so much packed in here; Wonderstruck is simultaneously the densest and loosest film Haynes has made. And, like many stories based on books for children, much of it makes more emotional than logical sense. Read full review&&Wonderstruck lives in the glory of its filmmaking — its photography, its costuming, its set design, its brilliantly variegated Carter Burwell score. Read full review&&A film of extraordinary details that adds up to less than the sum of its parts. But, oh, it gives a lovely light. Read full review&&Todd Haynes’ Wonderstruck is one of those films that I wanted to like far more than I actually did. Read full review&&Hard to say what percentage of Haynes’ adult audience will dig this one. I found it lovely to look at and emotionally underwhelming. Read full review&&Wonderstruck should not be confused for a brilliant but challenging film. Rather, it’s narratively deprived and with entire sections that are completely charmless. Read full review&&You know I’m trying to think of adjectives to describe Wonderstruck that are not “wonderful” but it’s automatically what comes to mind via the title. I think the best word to describe this movie is the other W word of “whimsical.” It’s an absolutely gorgeous in the whimsical way it depicts&&Absolutely gorgeous film in every way. The first half does an amazing job conveying what it must feel like to live in this world without hearing. By the second half I was so taken by the characters and how the story all intertwined that I must say I was "wonderstruck". This movie was&&Another fantastic film by Todd Haynes one of the best directors working today. Everything about the movie is wonderful. A magical story you fall in love with.&&This movie is good, just needs a bit of entertainment and that is all. Wonderstruck is kind of bad though, but it is great anyways. Thanks to the director.&&What should have been an endearing story and touching experience and a lot more emotional ends up being too cerebral and somewhat cold, besides that it took a lot of work to identify myself with the characters.But yes, the movie looks visually impressive, especially the sequences in black&&Two children living in eras 50 years apart set out to New York City on separate quests. Their parallel journeys lead them on an intriguing and sometimes spellbinding trip. Since both of the protagonists have lost their hearing, much of the film takes place with only music and sometimes&&What a waste of time. This movie was reminiscent of Scorsese's "Hugo" but with less wonder! We don't understand why we should care. The stakes were low. The children were cute, but it takes no work or energy to cast cute kids. I walked out after 70 minutes.&&
