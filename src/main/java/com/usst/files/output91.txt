summary: Master storyteller Wolfgang Peterson (Das Boot, The Perfect Storm) returns to the sea with Poseidon to focus not only on the power of a massive rogue wave that overturns a luxury cruise ship in open water, but on the intense dramas that play out among a small group of people fighting to survive in its aftermath.

A better reason to see Dream Warriors, if indeed there is one, is that it's really pretty gross and neat. [06 Mar 1987, p.D2]&&There are a few cheap thrills in Elm Street 3, but there are also plenty of effective effects, including mirrors-as-drowning-pools, Ray Harryhausen skeletal work and Freddy's body as a living frieze from hell.

The nightmares themselves are another reason for the series' success. Seldom have films explored the nightmare world with such effect, style, and panache.

The kids are all patients at a clinic where group therapy fails to stop their nightmares. What you get for your money are scenes with a severed head, the simultaneous injection of 10 hypodermic needles presumably filled with heroin and four long tongues that turn into arm and ankle straps for a sex scene.

It also has an often-dazzling comic impersonation of Lewis by Dennis Quaid, a goofy ballet of awesomely confident struts and brags. [30 June 1989, p.1]&&Great Balls of Fire! doesn't shake your nerves or rattle your brain; at times, though, it gets on your nerves. Even so, it's a just-tolerable junk-food chronicle of the brief era when Jerry Lee Lewis threatened to heist Elvis' ''King'' crown. [30 June 1989, p.5D]&&What's missing most conspicuously from Great Balls of Fire is an interest in the historical and cultural context that made Lewis' career possible - that moment when a dying rural tradition intersected with a booming urban economy to create a whole new kind of music and with it, a whole new America. McBride treats the '50s as a joke - a montage of "Leave It to Beaver" complacency and H-bomb panic. The truth is more complex than that, and a better story. [30 June 1989, p.A]&&Most of the cast of accomplished actors are wasted in these roles, although two do manage to stand out: Ryder as the innocent-savvy Myra and John Doe, in an underplayed performance, as her father.

comment: This is a brilliant and unpretentious movie to raise the bar for contemporary popular entertainment, designed for the upper-tier thinkers at the multiplex. Read full review&&It's made with seriousness, intelligence and craft, and filmgoers who aren't put off by the slow pace of life in 1380 should see it. Read full review&&Intelligent thriller. Read full review&&McGuigan's wonderfully ambitious but terribly melodramatic film is chock-full of symbolic references, subtext, and the sort of period detail that made Monty Python's historical comedies so gamely endearing. Read full review&&The story never gathers much dramatic momentum despite an impressive cast and a lot of dank Middle Ages atmosphere. Read full review&&The movie has none of the embarrassing absurdity and cheap effects that made last year's trip back to the 14th century, "Timeline,'' such a joke. We should be so lucky. Instead, we get a listless avenger drama. Read full review&&Although the acting is committed and sometimes stirring, most of the characters are about as one-note as the biblical archetypes Martin wants to get away from in the first place. "The Name of the Rose" this ain't. Read full review&&I did enjoy this movie. I don't think is an excellent film, but I don't think is bad. It is different and I like the fact that is not focused on the stereotypical image of 'the warrior' but if these guys are 'warriors' I like the fact that their swords are not literal, but their swords is&&Good Movie, very watchable, but the movie forces some issues on the views. Issues such as, actors are "done wrong" in the middle ages and Good will prevail. There are many holes in this movie, MANY. and many BIG movie mistakes especially at the end when the protagonist confronts Degese.&&

Read full review&&The filmmakers throw in an extended flatulence routine and enough graphic references to female anatomy to make "The Vagina Monologues" blush. Read full review&&Jackpot has much that is sweet and funny, but it is not overly original--and it is overly long and not as coherent as it might be. Read full review&&The movie is smart in small ways, yet an underachiever in big ones -- but it will probably play very well on television. On the big screen, it's distended and diffuse.

comment: It’s a long haul, but Please Stand By, meticulously directed by Ben Lewin (The Sessions), chronicles the pitfalls, terrors and triumphs of the trip with heart-wrenching realism. Read full review&&[Fanning] plays Wendy as a person and not a condition. Read full review&&It’s a relief to see an autistic woman played as more than simply a bundle of symptoms. Read full review&&Dakota Fanning's Wendy is less a truly thought-through character than a compendium of quirks. Read full review&&The film itself is often flat, akin to a very well-directed after-school special crafted exclusively to dramatize what it might be like to either live on the high-functioning end of the spectrum or care for someone who’s there.

Honest, but not pandering or pulling strings. I saw reviews basically demanding a dramatic roll-coaster performance of Fanning. Maybe something like a parody of the illness. No thank you. Like the illness itself, there’s no attempt to make the&&Please Stand By is a beautiful film. Of course it's not exactly faithful to the sickness, because it would be hard to write a story around it. But you get a good view of some symptoms and difficulties of autism. The acting is quite good and certainly convincing enough. The Star Trek side is&&There's certainly commitment from Dakota Fanning but the story by itself barely makes up for the time invested. I wanted more and the film failed to deliver.&&
