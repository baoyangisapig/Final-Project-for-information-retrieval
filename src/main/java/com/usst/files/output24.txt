comment: A superbly taut and well-made thriller that jumps from Geneva to Rome, from Paris to Beirut, from Athens to Brooklyn, each lethal assignment staged with a mastery Hitchcock might envy. Read full review&&This lengthy, nuance-filled story about how eye-for-an-eye stuff differs from theory to practice is one of the most considered, thoughtful, and involving movies of its kind. Read full review&&Some will find the surprise pleasant, others unpleasant. Whatever it is, it's the least commercial, most somberly heartfelt movie ever made by the cinema's most commercially successful filmmaker. Read full review&&As a piece of filmmaking, Munich is rarely less than gripping. As a political essay, as a brief against despair, it is far less convincing. Read full review&&Munich is at best a muddled prayer for peace whose weakness stems not from its politics but from the misconception of its main character. Avner is not just a fictional character, but an absurdly improbable expression of Spielbergian schmaltz. Read full review&&It's when Spielberg stops trying to think so hard that Munich works best. Though some of the assassination scenes feel a little too choreographed, more "West Side Story" than "Bourne Identity." Read full review&&It's too turgid and redundant to have any real impact. As a thriller, it barely thrills; as a lecture, it has nothing new to say. Read full review&&Family Entertainment at its finest! The show won me over when Bana's character and his band of assassins took off into the air on their bikes! Pure movie magic at its finest!&&I haven't seen all of 2005's biggies yet, but I think they will have to go some to beat Munich. It is the year's finest so far. The film is best appreciated by approaching it on two levels; it's a bloody, sexy political thriller and a study of a moral/ethical dilemma.&&I'm very surprised this film didn't even make it to the 80s, especially with all the 100s it got from critics. But just consider this: it's very rare for Beraldinelli, Ebert, EW, and Empire to ALL give the same film a perfect score (it's hard for Beraldinelli and Empire&&Incredible proof that an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, is madness. Good for Spielberg to brave both the Israeli and Arab opinions, let alone America's .&&The first hour and a half or so was absolutely terrific, it was really intense, but i got lost towards the end, it got sort of confusing, but i still liked it a lot&&Pedantic. A modest 90 minute tale crammed in to 160 minutes.&&Steven Speilberg has finally lost his mind. He now equates the sons and daughters of Isreal equal to, if not less, than the Muslim terrorists who commit all sorts of attrocities on civilization. Just wonder if Spielberg would turn the other cheek if someone he loved was brutally murdered?&&

comment: Lovesong is a rare film of mature, emotional complexity anchored by two remarkable and beautiful performances. Read full review&&[An] exquisite, beautifully shot meditation on love clouded by fear and doubt. Read full review&&Lovesong is carried by the actors’ chemistry and body language. Read full review&&Lovesong makes a virtue of restraint as it traces a complex emotional history in two parts, and innumerable (and sometimes quite literal) shades of gray. Read full review&&Director and co-writer So Yong Kim achieves a delicate, naturalistic tone both visually (many scenic outdoor settings involving rain, bodies of water or both) and melodically (a mostly soothing heart-fluttery soundtrack) that is underlined by handheld camera close-ups. Read full review&&So Yong Kim's film ultimately manages a convincing articulation of friendship between women. Read full review&&While Lovesong fails to coalesce, Malone and Keough emerge with two of their best performances yet, bolstered by an on-screen bond that deserves far richer material that what is offered up here.

comment: The best and most lavishly appointed, gorgeously photographed period movie in years. Read full review&&Colette is an origin story, a tale of metamorphosis rather than of already formed greatness. What interests Mr. Westmoreland is how a self-described country girl became a woman of the world, a transformation that in its deeper, more intimately mysterious registers remains out of reach of this movie and of the hard-working Ms. Knightley. Read full review&&This is a highly enjoyable and bracing piece of work from Wash Westmoreland. Read full review&&If only more period pieces these days were as finely tuned and accessibly pleasurable as Westmoreland’s film. Read full review&&Here, the focus is on Knightley, who delivers some of her best work. Read full review&&Politeness may be the film’s weakest point, whether with its characters or bedroom scenes. But it’s hardly something to complain about, especially when the company is this lively. Read full review&&A lot was left behind in this depthless account of a disaffected ghostwriter who wanted to affirm her artistic gift, freely and publicly. She actually did it with bravery and conviction, but this film doesn’t do her justice. Hence, my suggestion is: save your ticket money and read Colette’s biography instead. Read full review&&Cinematography: 9.529/10 The film flows well and looks good. Talk about subtlety infusing the camera as a part of the story.

And Colette may just be her best performance yet. Knightley plays Sidonie–Gabrielle Colette, one of the most celebrated French novelists of&&A fun movie with Kyra Knightley and Dominic West. You can learn a little about the author Colette and a bit about La Belle Epoque and wallow in some clichés about writing (sometimes writers do it more for the money than for art, etc.), but basically this is a colorful and entertaining film&&Definately this is not the kind of film that attracts many audiences but I found it interesting enough to take a look and I was honestly surprised.No doubt seeing it without knowing who Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette was will be strange for not knowing anything about her life and I didn't know&&despite a less than auspicious beginning, Colette finally finds a satisfying rhythm with the introduction of the first Claudine book. Keira Knightley and Dominic West have enough chemistry to keep the picture interesting and the costumes and music add another sumptuous dimension to a not&&It's a genuine shame that this film is so dull. The main performances from West and Knightley are so "one-note" that after my tenth yawn I gave up being impressed by the set design and the costumes. Pity.
