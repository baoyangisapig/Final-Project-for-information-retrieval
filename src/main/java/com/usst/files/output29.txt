Read full review&&Between the movie's frenetic bursts of energy, however, there's more than enough to enjoy, assuming you're not a Dahl purist. The best thing about the movie is actress Mara Wilson (who many will recognize from her role in Mrs. Doubtfire).

comment: The movie’s pretty great — not quite “Fargo” with lobsters but close enough, and about as good as regional filmmaking gets. Filmed in Harpswell, Maine and environs — the cobwork of Bailey Island Bridge curves through one scene — Blow the Man Down delves cleverly and suspensefully beneath the surface of a small, well-appointed fishing town in winter. There are bodies and there is blood. There are also a lot of quietly furious women. Read full review&&Inventive and original ... Juggling dark, situational comedy with genuine thrills is awkward, but “Blow the Man Down” manages to walk that tone well. Read full review&&From “Body Heat” to “Fargo,” women have driven the action in noir films before — but the way this one plays out, with AARP-age women holding all the cards in a setting we usually associate with rugged men, feels like a genuinely fresh take on a time-honored genre. And the ending, all cagey glances and serene indifference hiding some seriously twisted stuff, is downright delicious. Read full review&&Without Margo Martindale, the film would be a sharp and tightly constructed nautical noir. With her, it becomes a memorable one. Read full review&&Not a masterpiece that will change your life, but you’ve probably had your life changed enough lately. It’s 90 minutes of thoughtful, atmospheric, well-made entertainment, and that’s more than good enough. Read full review&&A briny Northeastern noir powered by women with secrets, Blow the Man Down is a pleasantly spiky slinging of small-town sin that should prove to be eminently companionable viewing for these sequestered, streamable times. Read full review&&While the sisterhood in Easter Cove is indeed powerful, the secrets that bind its members prove to be fairly simple, and the result is intriguing enough to make you wonder what these writer-directors might accomplish if they applied their vision to a more expansive canvas.

comment: What makes Phantasm special is the way it captures a boy's life in 1978. [Remastered] Read full review&&It deliberately makes no sense, but it has more bizarro gimmicks to the minute than any other horror picture of 1979. Read full review&&Over the course of three wild sequels, Coscarelli expanded his bizarre universe in a variety of imaginative and deliriously entertaining ways – but the original set the standard. [Remastered] Read full review&&Strong point of the feature is that it’s played for both horror and laughs. Read full review&&It's thoroughly silly and endearing. Read full review&&There is one thing you can say for the new horror film Phantasm (at the York): it certainly has its moment. [5 May 1979]&&Phantasm remains a pretty effective fright fest.

Phantasm est un film assez effrayant, il y'a une bonne ambiance et de bonnes scènes, surtout la scène culte de&&Phantasm is a really strange horror movie but also an one-of-a-kind story packed up with an eerie atmosphere and a cult synth score from Fred Myrow. Unfortunately the sequels wasn't as good as the first one but the original is still very effective.&&I don't think it's a perfect movie but I respect Phantasm for being different and for not really fitting in with any typical horror genre. And the fact that it is so hard to place makes it all the more worthwhile to watch.&&
