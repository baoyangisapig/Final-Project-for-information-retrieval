His smoldering pouts, crazed gleams, elevating eyebrows and erotically-contended smiles generate gleeful rabble-rousing excitement. And he can seem irresistibly funny in repose or invest minor slapstick opportunities with a streak of genius. Read full review&&From Elmer Bernstein's sweeping dramatic strings - perhaps the first counterpoint score in comedy - to the gleeful mixture of low-brow and lower-brow gags, Animal House is arguably the most influential comedy of our time.

The acting is also pretty good, and a lot of the scenes are well directed, including the ones that aren't even funny. Though not as funny as I expected, it is still a good movie.&&Directed by John Landis, "Animal House" was one of the first comedies to break all of the rules of film.

comment: Gone Girl is a terrific movie, everything the book and its fans deserve. Read full review&&Surgically precise, grimly funny and entirely mesmerizing over the course of its swift 149-minute running time, this taut yet expansive psychological thriller represents an exceptional pairing of filmmaker and material. Read full review&&Gone Girl reveals itself as an optimal meeting of the minds, a perfect amalgam of a writer and a director with complementary fixations. Read full review&&A sharply made, perfectly cast and unfailingly absorbing melodrama. But, like the director's adaptation of another publishing phenomenon, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, three years ago, it leaves you with a quietly lingering feeling of: “Is that all there is?” Read full review&&Like a film noir siren Gone Girl is beautiful, sexy, and fascinatingly mean — a nasty but estimable piece of work. Read full review&&By the end of Gone Girl, the social issues that animate the film's beginning — job loss in an economic downturn, differences in wealth and class, media manipulation — have receded, and things have gotten so plot-driven and pulpy, there's nothing to challenge the director or make him stretch. In the film's final stages he seems to be relying entirely on craft — but, boy, is it effective craft. Read full review&&There's a comic streak to the film that suggests David Fincher may understand the material as trash, but it's the kind of affectation that only reinforces, rather than dulls, its insults. Read full review&&A masterpiece of genre film-making. I felt like I was watching a long-lost Hitchcock classic (but one with all the sex and violence Hitch was only allowed to hint at). No spoilers.

It's hard to imagine his film done by anyone other then David Fincher, just an absolute masterpiece, that grabs you in and takes you through an emotional journey&&Well that was awkward. This thing just keeps getting weirder and weirder until the ending when you feel this strange feeling of ludicrousness flowing through your veins.&&Gillian Flynn's book 'Gone Girl' is one of the best novels that I have read in years. It has great characters, intrigue and a bold ending that would definitely not be to everyone's taste. It's a real intelligent page turner that once started can't be put down. The problem with 'Gone Girl'&&I have no idea how this movie could have gotten good reviews. It is long, boring, meandering, and in the end, utterly implausible.As an example of the implausibility, Ben Affleck's character ends up acting in ways that NO human could ever conceivably act in.
